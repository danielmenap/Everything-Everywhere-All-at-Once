INT. LECTURE HALL
Professor Jackie stands at the chalkboard in front of the
typical disinterested class of undergrads. On the board,
Jackie is illustrating the classic double-slit experiment.
He is drawing a wave-like pattern.
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          ... So when the photons pass
          through the two slits without an
          active observer we get an
          interference pattern suggesting
          they are waves. Now, what happens
          when we bring an outside observer-
          let’s say a camera, Devon?

Devon is sleeping. A classmate smacks him in the back.
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          That’s right, Devon. Through the
          simple act of observing the
          experiment, the photons are now
          behaving as if they are distinct
          particles...

Prof. Jackie begins drawing random dots all over the board
while looking at his students.
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          Not only does this discovery
          eventually pave the way for the
          entire field of Quantum Physics,
          but it also throws into question
          everything we believed to be true
          about-

His students break out in LAUGHTER. He scans the room for
the distraction. He looks back at the chalkboard and
discovers that his ’random’ particles have formed the
distinct shape of a penis on his chalkboard.

Prof. Jackie frantically erases the photons. He tries again
but despite his best efforts he forms another penis. His
face is stoic.
Instinctively, he looks over his shoulder and finds someone
standing in the doorway- a young Asian woman.
The blood leaves Jackie’s face.

                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          Class is dismissed.
No one moves.
                                                          2.


                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          I said class is dismissed!
Prof. Jackie throws on a blue-tooth earpiece as a diligent
student approaches his desk with a question.
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          Just check the portal for your
          homework, Gary! Leave! Go!
               (into earpiece)
          She’s here.
                    EARPIECE VOICE (O.S.)
          Get out of there! Now.
Everyone leaves the classroom as the Asian woman, JOBU
TUPAKI, slowly takes a seat in the front row, plopping her
book bag on the desk beside her.
Prof. Jackie looks at the door, then at Jobu. He suddenly
doubles over from a severe headache. He gasps and sits down
at his desk. He looks exhausted. Tired of running.

                    EARPIECE VOICE (O.S.)
          No. What are you doing? Run Jackie,
          we can’t afford to lose-
He pulls out the earpiece and places it on the desk.
                    EARPIECE VOICE (O.S.)
          Jackie... please...

The room is now empty and completely quiet. They sit across
from each other in silence. Jobu examines him.
                    JOBU
               (deadpan)
          I liked your lesson. Totally blew
          my mind.

Prof. Jackie whips a handgun out of the desk drawer and
fires directly at her head! Jobu sighs.
click, click, click, click, click- all duds.
Jackie looks at his gun in disbelief.
Amused, Jobu pulls out her phone to search something.
                    JOBU
          Do you know what the chances are of
          a factory produced .38 round being
          a dud?
                                                          3.


               (beat)
          Woah. 1/100,000.
Jobu walks over and gently takes the gun.

                    JOBU
          That makes 5 misfires in a row...
          one in one hundred thousand billion
          billion. So what are the chances-
               (points gun at Jackie)
           -of a 6th misfire-
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          I’m not playing your games anymore.
She cocks the gun.
                    JOBU
          What are the chances?
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          Joy, I know how scary it can be,
          knowing all that you know, but you
          are forgetting there is still so
          much beauty. So much hope.
Jobu rolls her eyes and drops the gun on the ground.

She grabs the professor by the hair and slams his head on
the desk. Then again. And again. Again!
                     PROFESSOR JACKIE
          Agh!   What are you doing?!
                    JOBU
          I’m trying to show you something.

                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
               (between impacts)
          What? That up is down, and pigs can
          fly? The universe is infinite, I
          get it, okay?
With each word, she slams his head into the desk again.
                    JOBU
          No. you don’t. Your concept of
          infinity- is- still- way- too-
          fucking- small-
Suddenly Prof. Jackie’s head floats through his wooden desk.
With his eyes wide open, he passes through the wood without
harming himself or the desk. How? He crumples to the floor.
                                                        4.


A shivering mess, he feels his face and reaches up to touch
the underside of the desk.
                    JOBU
          1 in a million trillion trillion.
                    PROFESSOR JACKIE
          What?
                    JOBU
          That’s the probability of every
          atom in your head tunneling through
          every atom of your desk, and coming
          out the other side whole.
Jobu tosses her book bag on the ground then rubs it’s back.
She flips it around, and suddenly it’s a pot bellied pig.
Prof. Jackie finds the handgun on the ground next to him and
examines it curiously. He places it against his temple.
                    JOBU
          Sorry, you’re not the one.

The pig unfurls beautiful wings and Jobu flies up through
the skylight of the classroom.
BANG. Prof Jackie’s hand falls limp next to the bluetooth
earpiece.
                    EARPIECE VOICE (O.S.)
          No! Shit! She got another one...

We follow Jobu through the skylight and suddenly she is:

INT. MULTIVERSE TRAVEL - VARIOUS
We travel with her from universe to universe.

INT BAR riding on a mechanical bull, her eyes scan the bar,
searching for something, then flies off-
EXT OCEAN flying through the air as a cliff diver passively
observing the divers below- still looking...

EXT CITY STREET a gutter punk who hops over a puddle and

Becoming more versions of herself in more unexpected
places. Flash. Flash. Flash. Until:

INT. JOY’S APARTMENT
Jobu lies in bed with a sleeping woman watching TV on their
laptop. Her phone phone BUZZES on her nightstand with a
call from "DAD." She picks up.

                    JACKIE OS
          Hello? Joy?
               (pause)
          If someone calls from the IRS, can
          you please say you are still
          working at the laundromat? I, um,
          forgot to change some small
          paperwork and now the government is
          causing trouble. Hello?
Jobu listens intently.

                    JACKIE OS
               (Chinese)
          Joy, I don’t know what you want me
          to do. You never call. You don’t
          come to see us. Your mother is very
          upset. I know you are mad at us,
          but we are your parents-
Jobu hangs up. She looks at the phone and shakes her head
no. Suddenly her head drops forward before snapping back up
like she was dosing off. The woman, BECKY turns in bed.

                    BECKY
          Who was that?
Jobu looks at the phone as if she doesn’t remember talking
on the phone.
                       JOBU
          What?
                    BECKY
          Didn’t someone call?

           No, you must have been dreaming.
She rolls over in bed and puts an arm around Becky.


ON BLACK
TITLE: "PART 1: EVERYTHING"

INT. CHAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - MORNING
JACKIE CHAN, in sweat pants and a over-sized polo
shirt, hangs up the phone. The years have not been kind to
this Jackie. All around him, years of tax documents and old
receipts threaten to drown him in his overpopulated
apartment.
Jackie puts down the phone and simmers. After a beat, he
shoots out of his chair and throws on his jacket.
                     WINONA
           What’s wrong?
WINONA, big perm and an unnecessary amount of make-up for
doing taxes, sits on the other side of the paperwork. When
they speak to one another its in Cantonese with pieces of
broken English thrown in for emphasis.
                     JACKIE
           Everything’s fine. I’m just going
           over there to talk to her in
           person.
                     WINONA
           You’re just going to lecture and
           get into a fight-
Jackie slams his palms onto the table causing a pile of
receipts to topple over. He looks up from his wife to the
crowded wall behind her filled with pictures of their
daughter, framed children’s drawings, and report cards. He
forces a laugh and smiles.
                     JACKIE
           No, there is nothing to fight
           about.
                     WINONA
           I know how worried you are about
           Joy, but you have to concentrate
           right now if we’re going to finish
           this today.
                                                          7.


Jackie relents. He sits down and picks up a receipt. He
stares right past it for a long beat.
And then a   DOORBELL RING. Jackie looks at the security
footage on   their TV and sees a laundromat customer
downstairs   is pressing their assistance button. He gets up
and rushes   out the door.
Winona is left to deal with the taxes. She sighs: typical.

MONTAGE - VARIOUS

INT. LAUNDROMAT - Jackie is holding up a shrunken sweater as
he is berated by an angry customer.

INT. APARTMENT DINING ROOM - Winona nods along as Jackie
passionately tells Winona the story, but not actually doing
any tax work of his own.
                       JACKIE
             ... You know me, I always mix the
             two words. "He", "she", "he",
             "she". In Chinese, there is only
             one word, so simple. Everything
             here is so messy. Boys wearing
             make-up, girls with shaved heads...

INT. LAUNDROMAT - Jackie is waving goodbye to some customers
as they leave, when he suddenly remembers something.
                       JACKIE
             Wait! I need you to review us. Give
             us 5 stars. Please.
                       CUSTOMER
             Um, okay...
The customer is about to leave. Jackie steps between her and
the door. His smile glows with desperation.
                       JACKIE
             Great. Can you do it right now?
                          CUSTOMER
             Right now?
                       JACKIE
             I have written a sample review in
             case you don’t know what to say.

Jackie holds up a sample script.
                                                          8.


INT. APARTMENT DINING ROOM - Winona is watching a Chinese
Soap Opera on T.V. and tearing up. Jackie sits down about to
start working on the taxes again. Winona smiles up at him,
but all he offers back is a distracted nod. They hear an
elderly voice coming from the other room.
                    ELDERLY VOICE (O.S.)
          Son... son...
INT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - Jackie is feeding his catatonic
father, YIEH YIEH, who is muttering to himself in Cantonese.
                    YIEH YIEH
          What am I doing in this horrible
          country? I could be home... I could
          be buried next to me father...
INT. APARTMENT DINING ROOM - Back in the dining room.
                    WINONA
          What did your father want?
                    JACKIE
          He was hungry.
RING. Jackie and Winona look at each other. What is it now?
EXT. LAUNDROMAT - Jackie approaches a homeless man
panhandling outside of his laundromat in his underwear.
                    JACKIE
          Excuse me, sir. You can’t be
          here...
An awful smell causes Jackie to recoil. The man’s soiled
pants sit nearby on the sidewalk. Jackie looks at the man
and sighs.
INT. LAUNDROMAT - The homeless man is wearing a robe while
Jackie is throwing the homeless man’s dirty clothes into the
washing machine.
INT. APARTMENT DINING ROOM - Winona watches from upstairs
through the security footage. It breaks her heart a little.
END OF MONTAGE

INT. APARTMENT DINING ROOM - EVENING

Jackie finally sits down across from Winona. The day has
worn him down.

                    WINONA
          I think I’m almost done, I just
          have a couple questions about-
                    JACKIE
          What is this?
Winona senses there is going to be trouble. They both try
their best to remain civil as Jackie rifles through stacks.
                    WINONA
          I think some things were in the
          wrong group.
                    JACKIE
          No, no, no. I’m going to have to
          re-sort everything.

                    WINONA
          Jackie, this is why we are being
          audited. You’re trying to deduct
          things like- karaoke machines,
          kitchen knife sets-
                    JACKIE
          We’re being audited because they
          are targeting immigrants, I read
          about it just yesterday-
Winona gets up and enters the kitchen to avoid an argument.
Jackie is too focused on the paperwork to notice. Winona
comes back with a pot of tea and some snacks.
                    WINONA
          Look, if we’re going to have to
          stay up all night, maybe we can do
          it together. It’ll be like college.
Winona puts her hand on Jackie’s shoulder. Jackie doesn’t
even look up from the paperwork.
                    JACKIE
          No. It’s okay. You know I usually
          work better alone. I promise it’ll
          be sorted out in the morning.

He pulls away from her hand. Winona has had enough. She sets
the tea on the table and walks away to her bedroom.
                                                      10.

Jackie takes a deep breath and looks over at the clock:
12:12am. He picks up receipt and holds it over one pile but
hesitates. He holds it over another and does the same.
He looks at the clock again: 3:00AM. He looks down at his
hand and instead of holding a receipt he is now watching a
YouTube video about African Pigs. He slams his head on the
desk. Trying to contain his fury, he mimes flipping the
table.
He pulls out his phone and dials in a number. He’s become
desperate.
                    JACKIE
               (English)
          Hi, I need help. I don’t know what
          I’m doing. Every time I think I
          know what to do, the rules change,
          and I’m lost again. My heart. It’s
          tired. Two by-pass surgeries. Two
          of them. I can’t afford another
          one. I could have been a great
          writer. Or maybe chef with his own
          restaurant. But, no. This is how I
          waste away my life. I just need to
          know. Is it all worth it?
There is a pause on the other side of the phone.

                    PHONE OPERATOR
          Of course its worth it! For only
          69.99, TurboTax is a steal, when
          you think of all of the time you
          will save. No headache, no hassle!
          Would you like to sign up for the
          current tax year?
                    JACKIE
          No, I’m being audited. The past 5
          years. And I don’t know what to do.

                    PHONE OPERATOR
          Oh, so you’re a returning customer
          asking about our Audit Insurance
          policy?
                    JACKIE
          No.
                    PHONE OPERATOR
          Oh, I’m sorry. We can’t help you
          with that, but if you want to avoid
          being put in this situation again
          we can get you signed up for a-
                                                        11.


Jackie hangs up. Everything hurts. He pulls out his
prescription pills, pops one, swallows without water.


FADE TO:

INT. CHAN APARTMENT BATHROOM - MORNING
Jackie sits on the toilet with the seat cover down. All we
hear is the sound of an empty shower RUNNING. Piles of
paperwork cover the floor and counter of the tiny bathroom.

He picks up a receipt and carefully converts a handwritten
"1" into a "7".


INT. CHAN APARTMENT - SIMULTANEOUS
Meanwhile, in the other room, we see Winona is adding sticky
notes to the only paperwork worse than taxes. Divorce
papers. The notes show her husband where to sign. She stands
up and walks to the door with a sigh.


INT. CHAN APARTMENT BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Jackie gives up. He piles the paperwork into his briefcase.
He flushes the toilet and stands by the door.


INT. CHAN APARTMENT - SIMULTANEOUS
Winona approaches the door, silently rehearsing to herself
what she is going to say.

SPLITSCREEN: INT. APARTMENT/INT. BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Jackie and Winona are standing on opposite sides of the
door, both paralyzed. They take turns reaching for the door.
Winona goes to knock, Jackie reaches for the knob. They both
pull back. They both inhale at the same time.
And then suddenly:
          JACKIE                           WINONA
Winona, I need to tell-          Jackie, we need to talk-
                                                      12.


Winona reaches for the knob, just as Jackie pushes open the
door. The door slams into Winona’s face. She YELPS in pain,
drops the divorce papers, and slams the door shut which now
smashes into Jackie’s face as well, causing him to drop his
briefcase, sending the tax paperwork everywhere.
Both their noses are bleeding, blood dribbling onto the
paperwork.

INT. CHAN APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Jackie turns on the sink quickly and scrambles to throw the
paperwork back into the briefcase before she comes in. He
stuffs toilet paper up his nose.

                    JACKIE
          Sorry! Don’t come in yet.

INT. CHAN APARTMENT - SIMULTANEOUS
Winona is doing the same, scrambling to pick up the divorce
papers. She stuffs a tissue up her nose
                    WINONA
          That’s fine! Take your time!

SPLITSCREEN: INT. APARTMENT/INT. BATHROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
                    JACKIE
          Did I hit you with the door?
                    WINONA
          No, no. It was just... a chair was
          in the way.
                    JACKIE
          Okay, good. Good.
They both manage to hide their respective papers and sit on
the floor exhausted, holding their noses.
                    WINONA
          We should go. We’re going to be
          late.
                    JACKIE
          Yeah, we’re going to be late.

They both sit there a little longer.
                                                      13.


INT. CAR

Jackie and Winona sit in silence as Jackie drives. In their
own worlds. They eat noodles out of tupperware at the
stoplight.
                     WINONA
           Hey. I know I had my doubts about
           you preparing all of the paperwork
           on your own, but I’m proud of you
           for following through this time.
                     JACKIE
           Don’t think of it. Caring for you
           and the family is my duty.

They both smolder in the silence.

INT. IRS BUILDING LOBBY - LATER
Jackie and Winona walk in silence.

Winona eyes an elderly couple in front of them. They are
holding hands. Adorable. The couple stops by the restrooms.
She hands him her purse and they kiss before she enters the
restroom. Double Adorable.

Winona looks down at her hand that is only a few inches away
from Jackie’s. Distracted by his own thoughts, Jackie shifts
his briefcase to the hand closest to Winona’s. She crosses
her arms.

They enter the elevator.

INT. IRS ELEVATOR - THAT MOMENT
As the elevator doors close, Winona’s head snaps forward and
she springs into action. She pulls out an umbrella from her
over-sized purse and opens it up. The open umbrella covers
the security camera in the corner of the elevator.
                     JACKIE
                (Chinese)
           What are you-
                     WINONA
                (English)
           There is no time to explain. You
           are in grave danger. Hold this.
                                                      14.


She shoves the umbrella into his hands. She rummages in her
purse and pulls out two out-dated blue tooth ear pieces and
places one in each of Jackie’s ears. She opens up a compact
mirror and twists one side, turning on a futuristic looking
interface. The blue tooth devices turn on and emit a
sweeping array of light that scans his head.
                    WINONA
          We need to get you out of here
          without attracting any unwanted
          attention, so pay close attention:
          When we leave this elevator, you
          can either take a right towards
          your scheduled audit appointment,
          or you can take a left and go into
          the janitor’s closet. Do not go
          into the janitor’s closet.
                    JACKIE
          Why would I go into-
                     WINONA
          Not now.

She shuffles through her purse and pulls out a pen and some
papers with blood stains on them: the divorce papers.
Before Jackie can realize they are divorce papers, Winona
begins rapidly writing on the back.
                     JACKIE
          Wait-

                    WINONA
          Once you are situated in the
          meeting, follow these instructions,
          but remember: act normal. We can
          not risk them finding us here.
She places the divorce papers with newly written
instructions into his hands.
                     JACKIE
          But I-
                     WINONA
          Shhh...
She places a hand gently on his cheek. She takes a moment to
look at him lovingly. Jackie shrivels under the intimacy.

Her mirror BEEPS: "100% SCAN COMPLETE"
                                                         15.


She twists the mirror shut. She closes the umbrella and
shoves everything into her purse.
She stands up straight as if nothing has happened.

                    WINONA
               (side of mouth)
          Talk to you soon.
Her head goes limp.
DING. The elevator door opens.

Winona’s head lifts up and she looks around disoriented.
                    WINONA
               (Chinese)
          Wow... what a fast elevator...
She walks out, leaving Jackie grasping for understanding. As
he leaves, his gaze lingers on the janitor closet to his
left.


INT. CUBICLE 9TH FLOOR   - MORNING
The back of the crumpled divorce papers lay in Jackie’s
hands under a desk.
The first line reads: "1. Switch shoes to the wrong feet."
                    DESMOND (O.S.)
          Mr. Chan... did you hear me?
Jackie hides the instructions in his lap and looks up.
DESMOND, a glistening, round IRS Tax Auditor in a cheap
suit, is poking at a calculator with one hand and squeezing
a hand grip strengthener in the other. Desmond stares at
Jackie, waiting for a response. Winona gives Jackie a look.
                    JACKIE
          I’m sorry. Could you repeat the
          question?
                    WINONA
          I’m sorry, my husband, he is, how
          do you say? Head in clouds? To
          answer your question: Yes, that is
          clear.
                                                      16.


                    DESMOND
          Good.
                    JACKIE
               (Chinese)
          What is clear? What was the
          question?
                    WINONA
          Shhh...
Desmond scoffs at a receipt and shakes his head in disbelief
before placing a big red sticky note on the receipt and
placing it in a pile of other similarly marked receipts.
                    JACKIE
          What does that pile mean?
                    DESMOND
          We’ll get to them soon enough.
He takes a big swig from a canned protein shake before he
looks at another receipt, and rolls his eyes at it before
throwing it in the same pile.
Winona looks over at Jackie discouraged.
Jackie’s eyes fall on his shoes. He makes sure no one is
paying attention. He unties his shoes, and slowly slips both
feet out. He switches his shoes and reties them.
He sits up straight as his eyes scan the room to make sure
he wasn’t noticed. He reads the next instruction: "2. Close
eyes, imagine you are in the janitor’s closet."
Jackie takes a moment to digest this next instruction. He
shakes his head and laughs at himself. He closes his eyes.
We see an imagined POV of the closet door.

Suddenly the bluetooths in his ears VIBRATE and and a green
light blinks on.
He looks down at the final instruction: "3. Hold that
thought and press the green button. P.S. Don’t forget to
breathe."
Jackie breathes in and presses the button-
Like the sudden sensation of falling, Jackie finds himself
shooting past cubicle after cubicle across the entire floor.
He crosses through the janitor’s closet door and finally
stops abruptly inside the closet.
                                                      17.


INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET / CUBICLE SPLIT SCREEN - THAT MOMENT

The small closet is cluttered and dimly lit.
In a split screen we see half of Jackie is in the closet,
the other half is still in the tax audit. He looks all
around him in both worlds. What just happened?
Note: this split-screen continues for the rest of the scene.
INT. CUBICLE:
                    JACKIE
          What is happening?
Desmond looks up, clearly frustrated.
                    DESMOND
          I already told you... <continues to
          speak indiscernibly>
INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET: Someone grabs Jackie and turns him
around. It’s Winona.

                    WINONA
          Shhhh... Don’t talk. Act like
          everything is normal. Try to go
          into autopilot.
INT. CUBICLE: Jackie’s tense body begins to relax as he
tries an innocent smile towards his wife. Desmond continues
to ramble.

INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET:
                     WINONA
          They do not know I’m talking to you
          here yet, so hopefully I’ll have
          time to explain: I am not your
          wife. At least not the one you
          know. I am another version of her
          from another life path, another
          universe. I’m here because we need
          your help.
                    JACKIE
          What the hell?
Winona covers Jackie’s mouth.
                    WINONA
          There is a great evil that has
          taken root in my world and has
                    (MORE)
                                                      18.


                    WINONA (cont’d)
          begun spreading its chaos
          throughout the many verses. I have
          spent years searching for the one
          who might be able to match this
          great evil with an even greater
          good and bring order back to the
          multiverse. All those years of
          searching have brought me here. To
          this universe. To you.
Jackie takes a moment to digest this information.
                    WINONA
          I know its a lot to take in right
          now but I need you to- <continues
          to speak indiscernibly>

                    DESMOND (O.S.)
          Mr. Chan... Hello?
INT. CUBICLE: Winona’s voice slowly fades away and the
split-screen focuses on what is happening in the cubicle.

                    DESMOND
          Mr. Chan... Mr. Chan!
Jackie takes control of his body again in the tax meeting.

                    JACKIE
          Yes! Yes I am here.
                    DESMOND
          Mr. Chan I’m sure you have a lot on
          your mind, but I cannot imagine
          anything mattering more than this
          conversation we are having right
          now concerning your tax liability.

                     JACKIE
          I know, I know. I am paying
          attention.
                    DESMOND
          Good. Then, can you explain this?
Desmond places a receipt on the table. Jackie looks at it.
                    JACKIE
          Wait, what are we talking about?
                                                       19.


                    WINONA
               (Chinese)
          God, the building could be burning
          and you’d still be stuck in your
          own head.
                    DESMOND
          I was just hoping you could
          enlighten me on how, as a
          laundromat owner, a karaoke machine
          would constitute as a business
          expense?

Jackie shrinks in embarrassment.
                    JACKIE
               (meekly)
          I am a singer.
                    DESMOND
          What?
                    JACKIE
          I. am. a. singer.
Desmond scoffs and shuffles through a pile of forms,
referencing them at random.

                    DESMOND
          I see, and apparently you are also
          a novelist, a part-time teacher, a
          chef, a motivational speaker...
          <continues to speak indiscernibly>
                    WINONA (O.S.)
          Hey!

INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET: Jackie’s attention is back in the
closet.

                    WINONA
          Did you just miss everything I just
          told you? I can’t afford to go over
          it all again right now!
                     JACKIE
          I’m sorry could we do this some
          other time? I need to make sure the
          government doesn’t take our
          apartment.
               (thinking)
          Unless, you have a way to help me
          fix my tax liability.
                                                      20.

Winona grabs him by the shoulders and pulls him in.
                    WINONA
          I know you have a lot of things on
          your mind, but nothing matters more
          than this conversation we are
          having right now concerning the
          fate of your universe.
               (she leans in)
          My dear Jackie, I know you. You’re
          reaching your twilight years. You
          want to be able to look back and
          say you did it right. You made a
          difference. And with every passing
          year, you fear that possibility is
          slipping away. Well, now is your
          chance. This is your moment. Don’t
          let anything distract you from it.
Jackie turns towards these words like a flower to the sun.
He can’t help but glow.
INT. CUBICLE: Jackie smiles even in the cubicle.

                    DESMOND
          Oh, so you think this is funny?
INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET: A loud BOOM shakes the door. Someone
is trying to get in.
                    WINONA
               (gravely)
          They know I’ve made contact.
                    JACKIE
          What are they going to do?
                    WINONA
          They are going to kill us.
                    JACKIE
          What?!
Jackie quickly picks up a broomstick and moves away from the
door. Winona grabs him to calm him down.
                    WINONA
          Do not worry, this is just a burner
          universe we are using for
          communication. The real you is
          still sitting in that cubicle.

Suddenly a fist bursts through the door sending splinters
everywhere. It grabs Winona’s face.
                                                      21.

                    WINONA
               (calmly)
          One day it will be your time to
          fight, but until then, get out of
          here. Stay low and out of sight. I
          will be in contact soon. Trust no
          one.
Another fist bursts through. Both hands grab hold of her
head and SNAP HER NECK. She falls over dead.
The hands open the door. They belong to Desmond. Only he is
different. He is robotic and precise in his movements.
He punches a hole in the wall and pulls out a metal pipe.
                    JACKIE
          No! NO! NO!

Desmond hits Jackie’ across the face with a deadly KLUNK. As
his head snaps to the side, the split screen swings away:

INT. CUBICLE 9TH FLOOR - THAT MOMENT

Jackie’s head snaps to the side as he SCREAMS.
                    JACKIE
          NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

He slowly opens his eyes and realizes he is still in the
audit. Everyone in the office is looking at him.
                       DESMOND
          Good lord.
                    WINONA
          Is everything okay?
Jackie stands up.
                    JACKIE
          Yes, yes of course, everything is
          very very okay. But I think I have
          to go. I forgot something at home-
                       DESMOND
          Sit down.
Jackie meekly smiles. He looks from Desmond to Winona,
checking to make sure they are really Desmond and Winona.
Jackie sits. Desmond leans in suspiciously.
                                                      22.


                    DESMOND
          Is there something you’re not
          telling me, Mr. Chan?
                    JACKIE
          Of course not, me? I am a book that
          is very open. Nothing to hide.
                    DESMOND
          You think I’m stupid.
                    JACKIE
          No of course not.
Jackie looks to Winona for guidance. She looks just as
scared. Jackie’s body tenses as he clenches his fist below
the desk. Desmond takes his time with his words.
                    DESMOND
          You know, people look at me, and
          hear what I do for a living, and
          they think "numbers guy, how
          boring." But when I look at this
          sea of digits and decimals, I see a
          story: a dramatic retelling of your
          year- no, your life.
He holds up their tax returns and flips through the pages.
Jackie is mostly noticing sharp objects that could be used
as weapons: scissors, a trophy, a letter opener.
                    DESMOND
          So when I start seeing these red
          flags pile up, they stop looking
          less like mistakes, and start
          looking like a man desperate to
          hide something- Do you know how
          these types of stories end, Mr.
          Chan.

                    JACKIE
          I’m sorry, what are you saying?
                    DESMOND
          I’m saying that either you’re
          absolutely delusional, or you are
          committing fraud to my face.
Jackie quickly pulls out his phone and translates
"delusional". Jackie stands up angrily.
                                                       23.

                    JACKIE
          I am not delusional-
Winona grabs his hand and sits him down in his chair. The
divorce papers fall from his pocket onto the ground.

                    WINONA
          Sorry, my husband confuses his
          hobbies for businesses. An honest
          mistake!
Jackie looks at his wife, hurt. She ignores him.
                    DESMOND
          With this many ’honest mistakes,’
          even if you aren’t charged with
          fraud, we’ll still have to fine you
          for gross negligence.
                    WINONA
          We don’t understand how this all
          works, but we are learning. Please
          let us go home and fix this. Can we
          reschedule?
Desmond crushes his protein shake bottle.   Jackie clenches
his fists in anticipation.

                    DESMOND
          Tomorrow morning. 9am. Last chance.
                    WINONA
          Thank you. 9am. Thank you.
As they slowly get up and leave the cubicle, Desmond’s stare
never leaves Jackie.
As Winona grabs her purse, she sees the divorce papers that
fell out of Jackie’s pocket. She picks them up, confused.

INT. 9TH FLOOR HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jackie briskly pulls Winona towards the elevator
periodically looking behind his shoulder.
                    JACKIE
          We have to get out of here.
Meanwhile, Winona looks at the unsigned divorce papers and
stops in her tracks. She puts her hand over her mouth.

Jackie stops and looks past Winona to see Desmond charging
out of his cubicle in their direction. He’s coming for them.
                                                         24.

                    WINONA
               (whispered)
          I understand why you were acting so
          strange. I’m sorry you had to find
          out like this.

                    JACKIE
          What are you talking about?
Winona holds up the divorce papers. From Jackie’s
perspective all he sees are the written instructions, from
Winona’s perspective she sees divorce papers.
                    JACKIE
          You know about this?
                    WINONA
          Of course... this came from me.
                    JACKIE
          What do we do now?
                    WINONA
          We cannot avoid having this fight.
                       JACKIE
          Right now?

                    WINONA
          What else is there to do? We can’t
          just run away from this. I’m sorry.

Jackie looks behind Winona and sees Desmond is getting
closer. He understands. He stops and turns to Winona.
                    JACKIE
          Winona, I know that I’ve let you
          down in so many ways over the years
          that you’ve stood by my side. You
          must see me as failure, both as a
          father and a husband.
Winona leans in close. Her eyes begin to water.
                     JACKIE
          And that’s why I’m going to prove
          you wrong.
                       WINONA
          What...?

Jackie pushes past Winona and PUNCHES Desmond in the face.
Desmond’s body crumples on the ground.
                                                      25.


                    WINONA
          What are you doing?!!
Jackie sees Desmond is holding Jackie’s briefcase that he
had left behind. The triumphant look on Jackie’s face fades
away as he begins to realize he has made a grave mistake.
Desmond cowers in fear with his hands over his head. People
run over to see what the commotion is about.
                    DESMOND
          Help! Call security!

Jackie looks at Winona hoping for some clarity.
                    WINONA
          Jackie... You can’t just hit
          people!
                    JACKIE
          You told me to do it!
                    WINONA
          Are you CRAZY?!
                    JACKIE
          I never want to hurt anyone.   You
          said its time to fight!
                    WINONA
          I was talking about us.

Winona lifts up the crumpled up divorce papers.
                    JACKIE
               (reading)
          "Dissolution of marriage"?
                    DESMOND
               (oh phone)
          Yes! I’m on floor 7. I don’t know
          what he wants, I don’t know if he’s
          armed...
Desmond has a phone pushed to his ear as he pulls tissues
from a box and begins to wipe his bleeding nose.
Jackie grabs Winona’s shoulders and begins moving them away.
Bystanders watch cautiously as they tip-toe by.
                    JACKIE
          Who gave you those?
                                                       26.

                    WINONA
          Nobody gave them to me.    We’re not
          happy, Jackie.
Jackie and Winona walk briskly towards the elevator.

                    JACKIE
          Your sister gets divorced and now
          you think divorce is okay!
                    WINONA
          I don’t think it’s okay!
                    JACKIE
          Then what are you doing? We love
          each other! Right?

Winona stops, forcing Jackie to turn around.
                    WINONA (CONT.)
          Jackie... I just wish you and I...
She slowly lowers her head as if to hide her tears.

Suddenly Winona’s head shoots up. Her eyes penetrate
straight through Jackie and she switches back to English:
                    WINONA
               (English)
          I told you to stay low and out of
          sight.

Winona grabs Jackie and they run towards the elevators.
                    JACKIE
          I thought they were after me!
                    WINONA
          You’ll know when they’re after you.
Winona rapidly taps the elevator call button.
The elevator door opens. It’s filled with security guards.
                    WINONA
          They’re after you.
                    DESMOND (O.S.)
          That’s him. The Chinese guy!
Desmond stands with an accusatory finger aimed at Jackie.

One security guard slowly exits the elevator with a hand on
his holster and the other hand cautiously reaching out.
                                                        27.

                    GUARD
          Everyone remain calm. I’m going to
          need you two to lie down on the
          ground with your hands behind your
          head.

Jackie obediently begins to lie down.
Winona reaches down and takes Jackie’s blue tooth from his
ears and places them in her own. She does not lie down.
                    GUARD
          Ma’am, please comply. We do not
          want any trouble.
Winona reaches into her purse. The security guards all draw
their weapons.
She pulls out her lipstick. The guards all relax.
                    GUARD
          Whatever you are thinking about
          doing, don’t do it.

She pops open the lipstick cap, twists it to fully extend
the stick, and then she eats the whole thing.
                      GUARD
          Ma’am...?
She chews and chews. The guards all lower their guns,
confused

The bluetooth VIBRATES and glows GREEN. She presses the
button. Her head snaps back as if kicked back by a shotgun.
She opens her eyes and flashes a devious smile to Jackie.

A security guard walks over and reaches to grab her arm.
                    GUARD
          Okay, that’s enough-
Winona suddenly grips his arm and snaps it behind his back.
He falls to his knees in pain. She axe kicks his head.
Just as the guards are about to fire their pistols. She
swings her leg in a large arc, knocking their guns from
their hands. As they charge in to grapple her and take her
down with their batons, she deftly fights her way out of the
tangle. All of a sudden, she is an incredible fighter.

From the floor Jackie watches in SLOW MOTION, as his wife
fights off every last guard. Confused. Impressed. In love.
                                                         28.


Winona knocks the last guard out. Everyone is frozen unsure
of what to do.
Suddenly an ALARM begins to blare across the entire
building. Everyone begins to frantically run for an exit.
Jackie stands up panicked and confused.
                    JACKIE
          Do you really want to divorce me?
Winona slaps him.
                    WINONA
          I’m not the Winona who wants to
          divorce you, I’m the Winona who is
          saving your life.
She picks him up like a fireman and runs away.
                    WINONA
          But, you should just try to be
          nicer to the Winona who wants to
          divorce you. She’s going through a
          lot right now.

CLOSET UNIVERSE - INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET

Jackie and Winona’s dead bodies lie in a pile on the floor.
A small boot steps into the foreground. Its Jobu. She looks
down at the bodies. She reaches down and pulls the earpiece
from Jackie’s ear and examines it.
Behind her, Desmond stares ominously at the evidence.
                    JOBU
          Not this one.
Jobu tilts her head back. She can hear something: THE
GARBLED SOUND OF A FUZZY RADIO SIGNAL.
Jobu rotates her head and Click! Click! click! We wind
through different universes:
CLICK - She’s stuck in traffic.
CLICK - She’s working as a barista at a cafe.
CLICK - She’s in her apartment with her wife eating lunch.

The FUZZY RADIO SIGNAL suddenly becomes clear:
                                                      29.


INT. JOBU’S APARTMENT

                    NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
          ... while there have been reports
          of several injuries, there has
          still been no word on who was
          behind the attack and what their
          motives may have been...
Jobu’s head turns sharply in the direction of the TV.
On the TV, we can see a helicopter shot of crowds of people
exiting the IRS Building.

                    BECKY
          Can we turn that off? I’m sick of
          all this bad news, every single-
Jobu abruptly stands up and leaves her half eaten sandwich
on the table. She marches towards the door, scooping up
their orange house cat, LINUS, on her way out.
                    BECKY
          Where are you going?

                    JOBU
               (without looking)
          Don’t follow me.

She’s out the door.
Becky runs to the window and watches in horror as Jobu steps
onto their cat’s back, and pulls it’s tail up, shape
shifting it into a handlebar shape.
With a rev of Linus’ tail, the cat’s mouth opens, a jet of
fire bursts from his throat, and Jobu rockets off down the
street.
Becky looks on in disbelief.


INT. IRS 9TH FLOOR HALLWAY - LATER
Winona is pulling Jackie along through the hallway. They are
passing small groups of frantic civilians running to safety.
                    JACKIE
          But my wife never learned to fight.
                    WINONA
          Not in this life.
                                                      30.


                    JACKIE
          So you know how to fight?
                    WINONA
          Not in my life either.
                    JACKIE
          How many Winonas are there?
                    WINONA
          A lot. I know it gets confusing.
          You can call me Alpha Winona, I’m
          from the Alphaverse.
                    JACKIE
          Alphaverse? That sounds stupid.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          You were the one who came up with
          the name, remember? How much of my
          speech in the closet did you
          actually hear?

                    JACKIE
               (lying)
          Most of it.
Winona suddenly stops at a corner and puts her hand up.
She’s listening to something.
She starts doing a dance. The Y.M.C.A to be exact.

She closes her eyes, presses the greet blue tooth button.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Two guards coming up the stairs.
          Try to blend in.
                    JACKIE
          What-
                     ALPHA WINONA
               (pretend screaming)
          Oh my god, oh my god, what is
          happening?
Out of nowhere, a group of frantic civilians run past Winona
and Jackie. Winona grabs Jackie, still screaming, and joins
the group.
A door opens and two guards come running up the stairs. They
run right past the group, not noticing Jackie and Winona.
                                                            31.


As soon as the guards pass out of sight, Winona stops
screaming and pulls Jackie into a cubicle.


INT. IRS 9TH FLOOR CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS
Winona is frantically searching the desk drawers for
something.
                    JACKIE
          Alpha? I don’t remember naming
          something Alphaverse.

                    ALPHA WINONA
          Not you here. My Jackie. From my
          universe.
The camera pushes into Winona’s head:     We zoom through
countless universes until we reach:

ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM

In a chair with an array of wires and cables flowing from
every angle, sits Alpha Winona. She pulls out a locket on
her necklace. Inside is a photo of Jackie. He’s got the
Steve Jobs glasses and turtleneck look.

                    ALPHA WINONA (V.O.)
          You were a brilliant man in my
          world. But most people thought you
          were crazy.

                    OFFICER #1
          Setting course for another local
          jump. Stand by for trajectory.

We reveal a dimly lit room filled with computer screens and
wires. A handful of people move from console to console,
pulling levers and switching knobs. It looks less like a
sci-fi movie and more like the back of a Radioshack. We see
an ever changing flow of data and graphics on the screens.
                    ALPHA WINONA (V.O.)
          In your search to prove the
          existence of other universes, you
          discovered a way to temporarily
          create a link between your
          consciousness and that of another
          version of you, a counterpart in
          another universe. While this
          connection was maintained, you had
          access to all of their memories,
                    (MORE)
                                                      32.


                    ALPHA WINONA (V.O.) (cont’d)
          their skills, even their emotions.
          You were in two places at once.

INT. IRS 9TH FLOOR CUBICLE - PRESENT UNIVERSE
                    JACKIE
          Like the Janitor’s closet.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Exactly. It’s called Verse Jumping.

She finds an egg timer and twists it. It begins ticking as
she sets it down. She reaches under the desk feeling around
for something.
                    JACKIE
          Did I come up with that name too?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          That doesn’t matter right now.

Winona finds a piece of chewed up gum stuck under the desk.
She eyes it for a moment before popping it in her mouth.
Jackie is appalled.
She closes her eyes and presses the blue tooth.
                    ALPHA WINONA
               (spitting out gum)
          There is an empty office three
          doors to the right, we run when I
          say go.
Jackie backs away from her frustrated.

                    JACKIE
          No! This is crazy... Why can’t your
          Jackie do this?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          My Jackie is dead.
Winona looks down for a moment. Beat.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Go.
                    JACKIE
          What?
                                                        33.


Winona runs out of the cubicle. Jackie follows behind. They
enter into an office three doors down, just as another group
of security guards sweep past.

INT. IRS 9TH FLOOR OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Jackie and Winona are lying under a desk just inches away
from each other. Winona stares into Jackie’s eyes lovingly.
He quickly looks away.
                    JACKIE
          How did I die?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          I’ve seen you killed a thousand
          ways. In a thousand universes.
                    JACKIE
          Why? Who wants me dead?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          An evil interversal being with an
          unimaginable power, Jobu Tupaki.
                    JACKIE
          Are you just making up words now?

Winona puts her hand on Jackie’s lips.
BANG. Down the hallway, a door is kicked down.

Jackie and Winona both go quiet.
BANG. Another one. Closer. Winona doesn’t seemed fazed.
Jackie can see boots through the crack of their office door.
They are about to open the door.
Suddenly a RINGING sound. It’s the egg timer. The boots all
leave the door.
Winona gets up and drags Jackie out the door. They run into
a stairwell.

INT. IRS STAIRWELL
They can hear police down the stairwell.    They speak in
hushed whispers:
                                                         34.


                    ALPHA WINONA
          We’ll have to find another exit.
Winona heads up the stairs.   Jackie chases after her.

                    JACKIE
          Wait. I don’t understand- why is
          someone hunting me down?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          I’ve been trying to answer that
          question for years.

She opens the door to the next floor.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR
The stairwell door slams shut behind them to reveal:
                    DESMOND
          There you are.

Desmond stands behind them.   He is wearing his own modified
bluetooth headset.
                    JACKIE
          Oh, Mr. Desmond, I’m sorry I was
          very confused before and-
Desmond picks up a post-it note and staples it to his
forehead. Jackie recoils.

                    JACKIE
          What’s he doing?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          He’s verse jumping. Run!
Desmond closes his eyes, clicks his GREEN blue-tooth. His
head cocks back. He opens his eyes and flips a table with
incredible strength.
Alpha Winona pushes a cabinet down in their way and they
begin to run.
The camera pushes into Winona’s head-
                                                      35.


ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM

Everyone is jumping to their battle stations. The energy is
frantic.

                    OFFICER #1
          He jumped somewhere: brute force.
          Sumo wrestler? Body Builder?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Doesn’t matter. Counter with
          someone agile.

We see a screen with a cluster of circles each representing
other universes. The interface rapidly scans the circles.
Three or four begin to blink.
                    OFFICER #2
          On your outskirts we’ve got break
          dancer, mime, gymnast-
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Give me gymnast! Go!

On the screen, we see rapidly flashing images of gymnasts.
                    OFFICER #1
          Calculating route...

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR

Meanwhile, Alpha Winona and Jackie search for
cover. Desmond flings cubicle walls and desks aside looking
for them.


ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM
On one of the screens, we see random paths from a central
circle to a highlighted circle that reads "Gymnast". The
various paths flash rapidly like lightning bolts on the
screen. Finally one path solidifies. "ROUTE FOUND"
                    OFFICER #1
          Paper cuts. Four of them between
          each finger.
                                                       36.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR
Winona spots some paper hanging from a bulletin board. She
rips some off and continues to run.

She starts trying to slice paper cuts in between her
fingers. But it’s not working.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Paper cuts only happen when you
          aren’t trying. It’s impossible.
                     OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
          Probability of 1 in 8 thousand.
          It’s the strongest jumping pad
          we’ve got.

Frustrated, Alpha Winona gets down on one knee and begins
concentrating on giving herself a paper cut.
                    JACKIE
          What are you doing??!

SLICE. One down.
Desmond is closing in on them.
SLICE. Two down.

Desmond picks up a computer monitor and throws it. It barely
misses Jackie’s head.

                      JACKIE
          Come on!    We have to run.
SLICE. Three down.
Winona is struggling with the last paper cut.
SLICE. That’s four. Winona closes her eyes, the blue tooth
turns GREEN. Winona is about to press the button.
Desmond catches her hand just before she can hit it. He
lifts her tiny body up in the air with one arm.
He slowly plucks each blue-tooth out of Winona’s ears and
they tumble to the ground. Winona struggles to get out but
there’s no use, he has the grip of an arm wrestler.
He opens the door to a nearby staircase and throws her down
the stairwell. He shuts the door and pushes a large filing
cabinet in front of the door.
He turns. Jackie is all alone.
                                                      37.

ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM
                    OFFICER #1
          He’s gotta run.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Maybe he can jump. Somewhere he can
          fight.

                    OFFICER #2
          He’s not ready. A jump like that
          will fry most people’s brains.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          He’s not most people.

INT. STAIRWELL

Winona is trying to push through the door. It won’t budge.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR

Jackie is crawling on his hand and knees through the
cubicles. Desmond has lost sight of him for the time being.
Jackie’s phone vibrates. Winona is calling him.

                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Jackie! Can you hear me? You’re
          going to have to jump. You’re going
          to have to fight.

                    JACKIE
          No, no more fighting. Can’t we just
          talk?
                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Jackie! You are in a war now! You
          can’t just kill the bad guys with
          kindness!
Jackie lets this sink in. He spots the two blue-tooths on
the floor. He picks them up and places them in his ears.
                      JACKIE
          Okay.
                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Concentrate on a universe in which
          you stuck with martial arts your
          whole life.
                                                      38.

                    JACKIE
          I only took three classes when I
          was little boy!
                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Just do it!
Jackie closes his eyes.


ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM
On one of the screens we see rapidly flashing images: Kung
Fu masters, a baby crying, a deer in the headlights, etc.
                    OFFICER #2
          He’s not concentrating. I’m having
          trouble locking in on the verse.

The lightning strike patterns of paths begin blinking across
the screen. "CALCULATING PATH".


INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR
As Jackie heads for a hallway, a desk crashes into the wall
blocking his path. Jackie turns and runs the other way.

                    JACKIE
               (to Winona)
          I’m gunna press the button.
                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Wait! You have to profess your love
          to Desmond.
                       JACKIE
          What? Why?

                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          It’s like eating the lipstick. Or
          switching your shoes.

ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM
On the screen we see the highlighted path through the foam
of bubbles. We see the center universe marked Point A
(Current Verse) where Jackie is. Far outside from the
Current Verse is a highlighted universe marked Point C
(Fighter Universe). Along the path, on the outside of the
local cluster, is Point B (A Universe where Jackie professes
his love to his Attacker).
                                                      39.

                    ALPHA WINONA VO
          It takes an immense amount of
          mental energy to jump to far
          universes. But you developed an
          algorithm that calculates which
          unlikely actions will suddenly put
          you in a universe on the edge of
          your local cluster, giving you the
          momentum needed to reach your
          desired counterpart. It’s your
          jumping pad.

INT. 10TH FLOOR
Jackie is quietly crawling through the cubicles, as Desmond
stalks through the floor like a minotaur in his maze.
                    JACKIE
          That doesn’t make any sense!
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Exactly. The less sense it makes,
          the better. Tell him you love him.
          And mean it!
Suddenly Desmond’s foot steps right in front of Jackie’s
face. Jackie looks up at Desmond in terror.

                    JACKIE
               (meekly)
          I love you?

The earpiece blinks YELLOW. Jackie goes to press the button.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Wait! Jackie don’t-

Jackie pushes the button.
Jackie’s mind launches out the building and we land in the
car with Jackie and Winona driving home.

TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. CAR [SPLIT SCREEN]
Jackie and Winona are sitting in a car. Jackie suddenly
realizes he is driving the car and swerves off into the
breakdown lane.
                    WINONA.TAXES
          What are you doing?!
Jackie chokes on his words.
                                                        40.


ALPHAVERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM

                    ALPHA WINONA
          Where is he? Did he make it?

ON SCREEN: We see the moment in the Audit where Jackie drops
the divorce papers on the floor, only this time they never
fall and Winona never sees them.
                    OFFICER #1
          He’s in a divergent universe: he
          went home after the audit without
          an incident.
                    ALPHA WINONA
               (gravely)
          He’s going home to finish his
          taxes.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR [SPLIT SCREEN]
Jackie panics and tries to punch Desmond. Desmond easily
catches his wrist and twists it. Jackie screams out in pain.
He laughs and slaps Jackie in the face over and over.


TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. CAR [SPLIT SCREEN]
Jackie tries to conceal his pain.

                    WINONA.TAXES
          I didn’t mean to spring it on you
          like this. Are you okay?
                    JACKIE.TAXES
               (strained)
          Everything is fine.

                    WINONA.TAXES
          I’m sorry, I had to do it like this
          because you never tell me whats in
          your head... and before we get a
          chance to talk about it, you get
          pulled away by something else-
An arm grabs Jackie’s collar and pulls him away-
                                                       41.


INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR

Desmond lifts Jackie over his own head like a professional
wrestler. He throws Jackie through a cubicle wall. He rolls
onto the floor, the wind is knocked out of him. The blue
tooth light goes out: he’s disconnected. The split screen is
gone.
Jackie realizes he is right next to the stairwell that
Winona is trapped in. Jackie rolls over and begins to push
the cabinet out of the way from the door.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          I’m sorry, Jackie. I gotta go.
                      JACKIE
          What?

INT. STAIRWELL
Winona has her hand pressed against the door gently.

                    ALPHA WINONA
          I need to find the right Jackie.
          And this one... I don’t think its
          the one. Sorry.

Jackie pushes the cabinet away.
                    JACKIE
          Wait, no! Let me try again!

He swings open the door. He sees Winona standing in the
stairwell. She looks utterly confused.
                    WINONA
               (Chinese)
          Jackie! What’s going on?

Alpha Winona is gone. Jackie shakes his head. He can hear
Desmond approaching. He quickly pushes Winona back into the
stairwell and shuts the door tight.
                    WINONA
          Jackie! Your face.
Jackie’s nose is bleeding and his face is bruised.
                    JACKIE
          You left me. You just left me.
                                                      42.

                    WINONA
          I haven’t left you yet. I just want
          to talk about it.
                    JACKIE
          That’s not what I’m talking about.
                    WINONA
          What are you talking about?

There is a loud BANGING on the door.
                    WINONA
          What did you get us into this time?
Her look of pained disappointment stabs Jackie in the heart.
His bluetooth begins to malfunction and flash GREEN:


TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. CAR [SPLIT SCREEN]
Jackie is back in the car.
                    WINONA.TAXES
          I was just really hoping we could
          finish this audit without the usual
          back and forth. Without all the
          pain. But I don’t know why I
          expected this time to be different.

Jackie looks down at the folded divorce papers he hides.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR

Jackie looks up at Winona with a new determination.
                    JACKIE
          I know what you think of me.
                    WINONA
          What are you talking about?

                     JACKIE
          You’re wrong. This time is
          different.
He kicks open the door.
Jackie turns to see Desmond leap off a desk and straight
into the air right towards Jackie.
On his knees he finally gives in.
                                                        43.

                    JACKIE
               (like a prayer)
          I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU!
The blue-tooth turns GREEN. He presses the button.

A shock goes through Jackie’s brain. Just as Desmond’s knee
is about to make contact with Jackie’s nose, time slows down
to a crawl.
The camera patiently pushes into Jackie’s head: The camera
moves through countless universes and stops:


FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT LIMOUSINE
The Martial Arts Super Star Jackie lounges in his limo with
a handful of handlers.
Jackie rapidly downloads all of the memories that
Jackie.Fighter has had since their significant life branch
occurred.

IN A QUICK SEQUENCE OF SHOTS, THE CAMERA IS PUSHING THROUGH
VIGNETTES AS IF A TRAIN GOING THROUGH A TUNNEL. WE SEE:

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. HONG KONG AIRPORT - 1970S

Jackie and Winona, in their early 20’s, Winona has her bags
packed and ready to go.

                    WINONA
          Can’t you see it? How wonderful it
          would be if you came with me?
The screen fractures like a prism, and we see two options:
one universe where Jackie follows her, and one where he
doesn’t.
We follow the universe in which Jackie.Fighter doesn’t:

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. HONG KONG BAR - LATER
Jackie.Fighter is in a bar, getting drunk by himself.
Someone knocks their bag into his head as they are walking
by. Jackie.Fighter gets up and drunkenly pushes the man
down. Cut forward in time:
Jackie.Fighter is lying in the dirt outside bleeding.

A foot steps into frame. Jackie looks up to see an old man
with a long beard: classic Kung Fu Master. He beckons.
                                                      44.


FIGHTER UNIVERSE - EXT. WOODS - LATER

Jackie.Fighter is going through all of the classic training
montage moments: carrying buckets of water up and down a
mountain, doing push ups, breaking clay pots with his fists,
but its as if a movie is being fast forwarded.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. KUNG FU COMPETITION
Jackie.Fighter executes a perfect kick to his opponents
face. SMASH CUT TO:

He is being honored with a medal. He looks at his Master
with a great pride. His Master bows his head. A man with a
cigar and sunglasses seems very impressed.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - SUPER STAR MONTAGE
A montage of Jackie.Fighter working with the sunglasses man
on a film set. Then another one and another one. We see a
montage of Jackie Chan’s classic Chinese films.


FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. HONG KONG BEDROOM - LATER
Many years have passed and now the Master is on his death
bed. Jackie.Fighter huddles near the bed, holding his hands.
                    MASTER
          ... never forget why you fight...

The Master breathes his last breath. We push into
Jackie.Fighter’s head:


INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR - ORIGINAL UNIVERSE
We are back in the original Universe. Not even a second has
passed since Jackie first connected. Time is frozen.
A single tear is suspended from his eye.
Jackie’s fists close tightly, and he inhales.
TIME RESUMES LIKE A SLAP TO THE FACE.
In one fluid motion, Jackie side steps the knee, and calmly
grabs hold of Desmond’s arm mid-air. He slams him to the
ground.

Jackie looks at his hands. It worked.
                                                      45.


Desmond attempts to grapple him to the floor, but Jackie
easily dodges the advance and kicks him with such a force
that Desmond is sent sliding across the floor, head first
into a filing cabinet. Desmond’s body lays limp on the
ground.
Jackie disconnects from the other universe and breathes
heavily. Winona cannot process what she just saw her husband
do. She runs over and lifts him up.
                    WINONA
          Why did you... how... are you
          crying?
Jackie bursts into tears.

                    JACKIE
          I saw my life... without you... I
          wish you could have seen it...
Winona is drawn in.
                    JACKIE (CONT)
          ... it was beautiful.
Winona pulls back to look him in the eyes. She begins to say
something, but her head falls forward and snaps back up.
Alpha Winona has returned.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Stay calm. This is completely
          normal. Your brain is under an
          incredible about of stress.
                    JACKIE
          Wait... let me finish with my wife-

Alpha Winona pulls him in and rubs his back like a baby.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Shhh, You’re not thinking straight.
                     JACKIE
          No, I was saying something
          important-
Suddenly Jackie hears VOICES. The bluetooth glitches. His
eyes wince in pain-
                                                      46.


TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. CAR

Jackie is suddenly sitting in his car parked in front of
their laundromat. Winona sits next to him waiting for an
answer.
                    WINONA.TAXES
          You finally have something to say?
Jackie looks at her confused. Winona waits.
                    JACKIE.TAXES
          Um. Let’s just finish our taxes.
          And then we can talk about it with
          clearer minds-

Disappointed, Winona opens the door. Flashing lights hit
Jackie’s face. We hear ROARING CROWDS, Jackie feels a fierce
migraine pulse through his head:

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. STADIUM

Jackie looks and finds himself in front of a massive crowd.
In the center of the stadium is a boxing ring.
                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Jackie... Jackie!
A hand grabs him and spins him around-


INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR - ORIGINAL UNIVERSE
Alpha Winona grabs him and pulls him closer.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Are you with me?
                    JACKIE
          I thought I was disconnected... why
          am I still there?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Most people don’t verse jump that
          far without months of training.
                    JACKIE
          What?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Your mind’s like a clay pot. Every
          jump opens another crack- something

                    ALPHA WINONA (cont’d)
          will inevitably leak through. With
          enough training, you should be able
          to block it all out.
                    JACKIE
          But, what if... I need to go back?

Alpha Winona looks him sternly in the eye. And slaps him
repeatedly.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          SHUT IT DOWN. SHUT IT DOWN. ARE YOU
          WITH ME? ARE YOU WITH ME?? COME
          BACK!!!
                    JACKIE
          I’m with you, I’m with you!

Alpha Winona regains composure. Jackie is terrified.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          You cannot think about those other
          lives like that. You are only using
          them to acquire special skills. Do
          you understand?
As Jackie nods, Desmond begins to stir. Jackie picks up a
potted plant to smash it on his head. Winona stops him.
                    DESMOND
          What is happening... where is
          everyone?

                    JACKIE
          He doesn’t remember?
Alpha Winona quickly takes an extension cord and begins
tying Desmond up.
                    DESMOND
          Hey man... I’m sorry about before,
          during that meeting, I can get a
          little aggressive sometimes...
                    ALPHA WINONA
          The man you were fighting wasn’t
          Desmond, your auditor.
                    JACKIE
          Another Desmond from another
          universe, like you?
                                                        48.

                    ALPHA WINONA
          Another universe, overtaken by Jobu
          Tupaki. She has used her great
          power to brainwash entire
          populations into doing her bidding.
          They can be anyone: your neighbor,
          the bus driver, your auditor. This
          man is just a pawn in their game.
She finishes tying him up.
                    JACKIE
          And so is my wife?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          You have to remember, we are
          fighting a war, and sometimes that
          requires us to stoop down to their
          level and- <continues to ramble>
Jackie hears the CHEERING crowd from the stadium. He looks
past Alpha Winona and sees into the stadium. He shakes his
head and tries focusing on Alpha Winona. But the CHEERING
comes back.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. STADIUM [SPLIT SCREEN]

He is back in the stadium in the middle of a press
conference. Suddenly everything goes quiet in Jackie’s head.
Someone has just walked in: Winona.
Jackie can’t help but be pulled in: The camera spins around
Jackie’s head. He is completely in this universe now.
Winona is smartly dressed, confident in her stride. Their
eyes lock. Time slows. Romantic Music begins to play.

                      JACKIE.FIGHTER
          Winona...
He hasn’t seen her in 40 years and a hole in his chest has
just been reopened. Jackie walks off the stage towards
Winona. He pushes his way through the crowd.
Everyone is staring at them.

          JACKIE.FIGHTER                     WINONA.FIGHTER
What are you-                      What are you-

          JACKIE.FIGHTER                     WINONA.FIGHTER
I’m sorry, you go-                 Wait, you go-
                                                        49.


They both shut up and stare at the floor. They laugh.

                    WINONA.FIGHTER
          I didn’t mean to interrupt... its
          just, it’s so good to see you,
          really... I saw your face on a
          billboard and... I’m sorry this is
          silly...
                       JACKIE.FIGHTER
          What?
                    WINONA.FIGHTER
          I was just curious to see if you
          still remembered me...

A hand grabs Jackie shoulder. It’s his AGENT.
                    AGENT
          What are you doing? Come on! We got
          a show to put on.
Jackie waves him away.

                       JACKIE.FIGHTER
          Hold on.
                    AGENT
               (through teeth)
          Do you realize how many strings I
          had to pull to make tonight happen?

He drags Jackie away. Jackie looks back but Winona is gone.
                    ALPHA WINONA (O.S.)
          Jackie! JACKIE!

He looks behind him:

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR - ORIGINAL UNIVERSE
Jackie is back in the IRS building. Alpha Winona looks at
him terrified.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Did you hear what I just said?
                       JACKIE
          Of course.
                                                      50.


                    ALPHA WINONA
          Then SHOOT!
Jackie looks down at his hands. He is now holding a giant
futuristic gun made of office products. What?
He looks up and sees an entire SWAT team approaching them
with their guns raised. WHAT?
                    SWAT LEADER
          I said drop your weapon!!
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Don’t listen to them Jackie!
Jackie drops the gun in panic. Alpha Winona dives for the
gun. She fires the gun, but only a flag that says "BANG!"
comes out.
                    JACKIE
          What just happened?
                    ALPHA WINONA
               (petrified)
          She’s here.
Two small boots stalk across the hallway. It’s Jobu. She is
carrying her orange cat and calmly walking towards them.
                     JACKIE
          Joy?

Jackie recognizes his daughter, JOY. He can’t turn away.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          She’s found us. We have to go. NOW!

Alpha Winona drops the gun and begins to run away.
                    SWAT OFFICER
               (to Jobu)
          Miss, you can’t be up here.
                    JOY
          You have to be more clear: "can’t"
          is such a... fluid word. Is it that
          I am not able to be here or that I
          am not allowed to be here?
Jobu slowly slides her boot across the floor and taps the
ground with her toe.
                                                      51.

                    JOBU TUPAKI
          It seems physically possible for me
          to be here, so...
The SWAT Officer has no patience for this.

                    SWAT OFFICER
          Okay, that’s enough. You and your
          cat gotta go...
He reaches out to grab her arm. She pulls away.
                    JOBU TUPAKI
          Hey, you can’t do that.
                    SWAT OFFICER
          I am able to, and I am allowed to
          because it is within my duty to-
                    JOBU TUPAKI
               (threatening)
          Believe me, you can’t.

The SWAT Officer reaches for his handcuffs with one arm and
tries to grab her with his other. But before he can touch
her, she throws her cat in the air. The cat catches onto her
forearm, locking its legs around her wrist, with its tail
facing out. Jobu pulls on the tail, unsheathing a long
blade. She plunges the blade into the policeman’s gut.
                    SWAT OFFICER
          Why did you stab me with a cat?

                    JOBU TUPAKI
          Because I can.
He falls to the ground. The cat falls off her arm and starts
licking the guy’s face. Jackie’s brain is broken.
                    SWAT OFFICER
          Fire!!
                    JACKIE
          No!!!
The SWAT team all fire. Bullets fly.
Jobu falls to the ground and moves like a crazy drunk
person. Somehow erratic movements are helping her dodge
every bullet. She swings her cat by the tail, transforming
it into a long medieval chain and ball, that she uses to
knock the guns out of the hands of the SWAT officers. She
lets go of the tail, and the cat becomes a cat again,
clawing at the face of one of the unarmed officers.
                                                         52.


Jobu sweep kicks two officers off their feet. While she is
on the ground, two more men approach her from either side,
swinging batons which she catches and turns into large
dildos. She spins the toys around, and shoves them into
their Adam’s apples with a loud crunch, they both fall on
the ground gasping.
Alpha Winona grabs Jackie’s arm but he doesn’t want to
leave.
                    JACKIE
          How... is Joy doing that?

                    ALPHA WINONA
          That’s not your Joy anymore...
          she’s a monster now. I was going to
          tell you.
Jackie doesn’t want to believe it.
Linus the cat comes sauntering back with a large ammunition
clip in his mouth.

Jobu shoves the ammunition clip into Linus’ butt and
stretch’s the cat’s legs out straight like a gun. She kneels
down beside Desmond and pats him on the head.
                    JOBU
          Oh sweetie, thanks for the help,
          but I won’t be needing you here
          anymore.

                    DESMOND
          What- what are you?
Jobu cocks her cat gun. She aims it a Desmond. Jackie grabs
her hand at the very last minute. Desmond is shot in the
leg.
                    DESMOND
          Owwww!
                    JACKIE
          Stop! Why do you do this, Joy?
                    JOBU
          Why does anyone do anything?
                    JACKIE
          I raised you better than this.
                                                      53.


                    JOBU
          No. No you didn’t.
She raises her gun to shoot Desmond in the head. Jackie
knocks the gun down. Desmond gets shot in the leg again.
                    DESMOND
          Owww!!! The same hole!?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Jackie, come on!
Jackie plants his feet.
                    JACKIE
          All I ever did was give you the
          best I could. You know I love you
          even though you are a gay.
Jobu stares down her dad.
                    JOBU
          You’re still hung up on the fact
          that I like girls?
               (in his face)
          The universe is much bigger than
          you realize Dad. I’m not really gay
          anymore.
               (Chinese)
          I’ve fucked everything.
                    JACKIE
          You show some respect!
                    JOBU
          You’ve fucked everything too. Men.
          Dogs. Cars...
Jobu picks up a picture frame and transforms it into a
picture of Jackie posing lovingly with Chris Tucker, a dog,
a car.
                    JACKIE
          Never.
Jobu smirks. She’s enjoying this. The picture flickers and
becomes a stack of books, a swarm of bees, a baby pig, a
watermelon.
                    JOBU
          In this very moment, there’s a
          world where you’re having
          intercourse with this watermelon.
                                                      54.


Jackie begins to step away from the melon.

                    JACKIE
          That can’t be true.
               (to Alpha Winona)
          Can it?
Alpha Winona can’t give him an answer.
She rotates it to reveal a 2 inch hole. Jackie shakes his
head, but he can’t look away. He is almost hypnotized.
                    JOBU
          Don’t be ashamed. You’re a hero. In
          that universe, fucking this
          watermelon is the right thing to
          do.
                    JACKIE
          That doesn’t make any sense!
                    JOBU
          You’re starting to get it.

Jackie’s mind is overwhelmed. A fly BUZZES by. Something
leaks through:


TAXES.UNIVERSE - CHAN APARTMENT
Jackie swats a fly. Winona reads aloud at the computer.

                    WINONA
          It says here, an activity is
          considered a business only if it
          makes a profit during at least 3 of
          the last 5 tax years-
                    JACKIE
          Shhhhhhh. Not now!

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR
Jackie shakes the leak and approaches Jobu.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          What are you doing?
                    JACKIE
          I am going to talk some sense into
          my daughter.
                                                        55.


                    ALPHA WINONA
          Jackie, she can’t be reasoned with.
Jackie has an idea.

                    JACKIE
          Then I’ll verse jump. Somewhere
          where I am very very good at
          talking. And I will touch my
          daughter’s heart. And then maybe
          she will no longer be an evil gay.
Alpha Winona is bewildered. Jackie closes his eyes to
concentrate. It doesn’t work-

TAXES.UNIVERSE - CHAN APARTMENT
Jackie glances out the window, avoiding Winona’s glare.
                    WINONA
          Why are you acting like this?

                    JACKIE
          I don’t need extra rules! You’re
          complicating things. I have a
          simple plan.

Jackie sees a picture on the wall of Joy as a child. Beside
the photo is a child’s drawing of a man with wiggle worm
fingers, autographed "JOY." Jackie reaches for his head like
he has a migraine.


FIGHTER UNIVERSE - STADIUM
Jackie is standing across from another younger fighter. An
announcer holds a microphone in front of his face.
                    ANNOUNCER
          So Jackie, do you truly believe you
          can win this fight against a man
          half your age, at the prime of his
          career?
There are flash bulbs going off all around him. He is
looking through the crowd, searching for Winona. There’s a
guy selling hot dogs.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR

Jackie looks up. Alpha Winona is now standing between Jackie
and Jobu, concerned.

                    ALPHA WINONA
          Jackie, please. You can’t just jump
          without a guided trajectory, you
          can end up anywhere-
Jackie pushes her aside. He places his hand over the blue
tooth.

ALPHAVERSE - In the control room, we see flashes of images
on the screen: a clenched fist, hot dogs, Joy’s portrait,
Joy’s childhood drawing, back to a fist, etc.
                    WINONA
          Your mind is already too fragile-
                    JACKIE
          I LOVE YOU.

Jobu is momentarily confused. Winona reaches out.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          No! Jackie that’s not how it works-

Jackie presses the blue tooth. His head cocks back.
Both his hands go limp as if they have been pumped full of
anesthesia. He tries to punch Jobu, but his floppy fingers
just enter the watermelon hole.
                    JACKIE
          EW! EW! EW!

          He’s off the fucking map.

HOTDOG.UNIVERSE - CHAN APARTMENT
Jackie stands in front of a full length mirror in a suit
with an untied tie. He lifts his hands into frame. His
fingers are floppy hot dogs. Jackie cannot comprehend it.

He tries to tie his tie but his boneless fingers just push
it around. His frustration builds.
Winona leans in the doorway. She has hot dog hands as well.

                    WINONA
          Jackie, why are you-
                      JACKIE

          of fingers.

          That jump would fry most people.

          Like I said, he’s not most people.
The fingered monkey’s outstretched hand falls limp.

Jackie stumbles back into a desk. He tries to catch himself
but his fingers are useless and he crumples onto the floor.

                    JOBU
          It’s like you said. It doesn’t make
          sense. None of it does.
Jobu stands over Jackie with her cat gun.

          If it makes you feel any better. In
          another universe. I’m not about to
          kill you.
She cocks her cat gun: chk-chk-meow.
A foot flies into frame and kicks the cat into the air. It’s
Alpha Winona.
                     ALPHA WINONA
          Go! Now!

She turns to punch Jobu, but Jobu catches her wrist easily.
                    JOBU
               (looking deeply in her eyes)
          Hi mom.
Jobu takes her finger and places it on Winona’s forehead.
Winona is petrified.

                    JOBU
          Which mom are you?
She lifts her head to tune into a unheard frequency. CLICK,
CLICK, CLICK. She’s gone.
Joy lifts her head. It’s normal Joy. She looks around
confused.
                    JOY
          Mom? Dad? What the fuck is
          happening? Where am I?
                     ALPHA WINONA
          Oh no...

Alarms are flashing, there is a distant explosion / rumble.
Officer #1 is looking at a monitor of chaos outside.

          She’s found us. She’s here.

INT. IRS 10TH FLOOR
Alpha Winona turns to Jackie.

                    ALPHA WINONA
          Get us as far away from her as you
          can. I’ll be back.
She hangs her head and snaps back as normal Winona.
                    WINONA
          What just happened?... Joy? What
          are you doing here?

Joy is scrolling through her phone: Missed calls and
messages.
                    JOY
          I have no fucking clue!
                    WINONA
          Watch your language!

                    JOY
               (on phone with wife)
          Hey, yeah, I’m fine, I just... I
          don’t know what’s happening.

Jackie grabs Winona’s arm.
                    JACKIE
          We have to go. Come on.
                    WINONA
          No. What about Joy?
                    JACKIE
               (whispered to Winona)
          She’s not who you think she is.
Ignoring Jackie, Winona approaches her daughter.
                                                      60.


                    WINONA
          Joy? Who is that you’re talking to?
                    JOY
          Just come pick me up and we’ll
          talk. I’m - um - where are we?
                    WINONA
          The IRS building, your dad has got
          us all into another huge mess.
                    JACKIE
          This isn’t my fault!
                    JOY
          The IRS building apparently.
                    WINONA
          Who are you talking to joy?
Winona reaches for Joy’s phone. Joy pulls the phone away but
she’s too slow.

                    WINONA
          Who is this?
                    BECKY (O.S.)
          This is Becky.
                    WINONA (O.S.)
          Who? Becky who?

                    BECKY
          Becky. Joy’s wife.
Winona’s jaw drops.

                    WINONA
          You got married? And you didn’t
          tell us.
Jackie is also shocked. He forgets his need to run.
                    WINONA
          This is your fault... You are
          always too hard on her.
                    JACKIE
          After everything we have sacrificed
          to bring you here... Such
          disrespect, not to invite your own
          parents-

                    JOY
          Invite you!? Would you have
          come? No. Every time I’ve tried
          to come out to you, you’ve ignored
          me. You tell me its a phase.
Winona is pacing the room. Freaking out.
                    JACKIE
               (to Winona)
          No, she’s not a gay.
                    JOY
          What are you talking about? Of
          course I am.

                    JACKIE
          No, you’re a monster now.
This kills Joy. She is done. She storms off.
                    WINONA
          Joy.
               (to Jackie)
          Why would you say this!?
Winona tries to follow but Jackie grabs her arm.

                    JACKIE
          We have to go.
                    WINONA
          No, no more of your craziness. It’s
          tearing our family apart.
                    JACKIE
          Hah! Everything I do is for our
          family. You don’t care about
          family. You want to give up.

                    WINONA
          You’re so caught up in your own
          head you can’t feel your daughter’s
          pain. You can’t feel mine. If you
          just let me explain the divorce
          papers-
                    JACKIE
          I don’t want to hear about that.
          It’s too late.

She starts to say something. Winona’s head falls back.
                                                        62.


                    ALPHA WINONA
          Why are we still here?
Before he can answer, Alpha Winona drags him away.


INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR HALLWAY
Jackie is chasing Alpha Winona through a doorway.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          She’s broken through our defenses.
          I don’t know how much time we have.
Alpha grabs supplies from desks as she runs.    Batteries,
tape, thumbtacks.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          You are not strong enough yet to
          defeat Jobu. Go into hiding. Train
          your mind. Prepare yourself for
          your final fight.

                    JACKIE
          But I just talked to her, my Joy.
Alpha Winona picks up a computer tower and smashes it on the
ground she grabs some pieces of the logic board.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          That’s the problem. As long as
          there is still a Joy anywhere, then
          Jobu still exists. She is
          everywhere, in every Joy.
                    JACKIE
          How?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Remember when I told you not to
          fall to the charms of the other
          verses?
                    JACKIE
          Is that what happened to Joy?
She drags Jackie into a women’s bathroom and locks the door
behind them. She pulls out a small eyeglasses repair kit
from her purse and begins modifying her bluetooth headset.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Joy was extremely gifted at verse
          jumping. Our little explorer... You

                    ALPHA WINONA (cont’d)
          can’t blame yourself. You were so
          excited by the possibilities.
          Imagine what we could have done
          with the collective knowledge of
          all these worlds. Cured diseases,
          ended wars. You... you...

                    JACKIE
               (understanding)
          I pushed her too hard.
Alpha Winona nods grimly.

ALPHA.VERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM FACILITY
Jobu is walking down a hallway wearing a large hooded cloak.
Smoke and fire are all around.
                    ALPHA WINONA (V.O.)
          Her mind was fractured. We
          shattered the filter that upholds
          the illusion that she exists in one
          linear reality. Now her mind exists
          in every world. Every possibility.
          All at once.

With every step, we see her in a different universe living a
completely different life: a mother walking down a grocery
aisle, a teacher walking past her students, etc.
                    ALPHA WINONA (V.O.)
          She’s seen too much. Lost any sense
          of morality. Any sense of
          objectivity. Now she’s wreaking
          havoc in my world, and many others,
          by opening their eyes to the
          darkness of the multiverse.
We see the officers in the control room arming themselves
and running out to join the fight.
Outside, Jobu is surrounded by dead and wounded. The world
looks like suburban America after a riot. Burned churches,
defaced political billboards.
                    ALPHA WINONA (V.O.)
          The multiverse allows everyone
          could see whatever they wanted to
          see, hold on to whatever version of
          the truth they want to. By eroding
          any common ground, she destroyed us

          have a chance.


INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BATHROOM
Winona produces a helmet of wires and flashing lights she’s
been building. A collection of thrown together technology.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          When the time comes, you have to
          stop her with this.
                    JACKIE
          But, you just built that. Out of
          junk.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Jackie, this helmet will deliver a
          powerful shock to every possible
          version of Joy, killing her in
          every universe.
                    JACKIE
          Killing her...?

                    ALPHA WINONA
          She’s my daughter too Jackie. But
          there is no room for compromise. No
          time for our own emotions.

                     JACKIE
          No.   I’m not the right one.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Yes you are.
                    JACKIE
          I’ve never been good at anything.
                     ALPHA WINONA
          Exactly.
                     JACKIE
          What?
                    ALPHA WINONA
          I’ve seen thousands of Jackies, but
          never a Jackie with a life so full
          of... failures. You have so many
          things you never finished. Dreams
          you never followed.

          I’m working on a couple things.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Can’t you see? Every failure here,
          is a success for another Jackie in
          another universe. Most people only
          have a few significant alternate
          life paths so close to them. But
          you, here... you’re capable of
          anything because you’ve been so bad
          at everything.
Jackie soaks this in.


ALPHA.VERSE - INT. CONTROL ROOM
Jobu steps into the control room where Winona is all alone
connected to her helmet. Winona is calmly waiting for her.

Winona takes a healthy swig from a bottle of wine.

She grabs Jackie by the collar, choking him.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Jackie promise me when the time
          comes, no matter what she says, no
          matter what you see in other
          universes- you’ll finish this!
Before Jackie can answer, her furious grasp turns into a
tender embrace. She hold’s Jackie’s head in her hands.
                    ALPHA WINONA (CONT.)
          It’s been so good seeing you again.
          Whatever happens, I’m grateful that
          random chance was so kind as to
          give us these last moments
          together.
She grabs each of his hands and places them around her. She
goes into kiss him.
Jackie’s body tenses up.

As they’re about to kiss, her lips quiver, her breath
trembles, and her eyes roll back. Her head goes limp.
                                                       66.


Jackie doesn’t know what to do.

                    JACKIE
          Winona? Winona?

He holds her tight. Winona lifts her head in a daze.
                    WINONA
          Jackie? I don’t feel good...
Jackie pulls away. Alpha Winona is gone. Winona looks around
and realizes she is in the bathroom.

                    JACKIE
               (broken)
          She killed you.

          What? I’m not dead. Am I?
                    JACKIE
          I have to stop her.

He picks up the helmet contraption and studies it as he
paces the room with a determined look.
                    WINONA
          Jackie... I feel like I’m going
          crazy! I blink, and I’m somewhere
          else! What is happening?
                    JACKIE
          You’re not crazy. You don’t
          remember because the other Winona
          was controlling you.

          You know... the cartoon. We watched
          it for Joy’s birthday. With the

          That’s you.

          No, it’s Raccaccoonie. Like

Jobu stands over Alpha Winona’s dead body.
She turns to the console where we see Jackie in the
bathroom.
She clicks to another universe.


JOBU CULT UNIVERSE - CATHEDRAL
Jobu is now in a long cathedral hall.
Jobu stands before rows of people in cloaks with verse
jumping equipment hooked up to them. It’s an eclectic
bunch: young and old, tall and stout, from all walks of
life.

          Brothers and Sisters, I believe I

EXT. IRS BUILDING

The same skinny old lady is outside the IRS building wearing
a lunch lady’s uniform. Her head goes limp. She turns and
makes her way through the crowd of evacuees. We see a
handful of others suddenly walking towards the building:
auditors, security guards, random civilians.

Desmond is still tied up and bleeding on the floor.

          Hello?    Help, is someone there?

Desmond’s head droops and he lifts his head again. He has
been taken over again. He picks up a coffee maker and rips
it in half. He uses the heat to cauterizes his gunshot
wound.
He looks up just as Jobu walks in, followed by several other
Followers. She picks up a business card raffle box and dumps
the cards on the ground. As they fall in the air they turn
to verse jumping devices.

Jackie and Winona stand at opposite ends of the bathroom.
Winona is deep in thought. Jackie waits for her to speak.

          So, how many universes are there?

          As many as you can imagine.

PINK ELEPHANT UNIVERSE - EXT. PLAINS
Winona is wearing a nice pants suit riding a pink elephant.
                    PINK ELEPHANT
          I am pink because I only eat
          shrimp.

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT
                    JACKIE
          I guess...? I know it sounds crazy
          but, I’ve already seen so much.
                    JOBU (O.S.)
          Jaaaackiiiieeee?

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR
Jobu stands in the back surrounded by a rag tag group of
strangers. They stand menacingly as they fashion weapons out
of every day objects.
                    JOBU
          I’m sure you’re just as sick of
          wondering whether or not you’re
          "the one" as I am. Let’s just get
          this over with.

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BATHROOM
                    WINONA
          So what now? To save the world,
          you want to kill your own daughter
          because she’s an evil monster?
                    JACKIE
          We have to do something. She is our
          responsibility. I’m going to find a
          way to fix this.
                    WINONA
          You say that every time, right
          before you make things worse.
Winona turns away in frustration.
                    WINONA
          Why don’t you just jump to a
          universe where, for once, you
          actually know what to do?
                                                      70.


This gives Jackie an idea.

He rushes over to the soap dispenser and throws soap in his
eyes. It stings. He closes his eyes and concentrates, but
the bluetooth turns YELLOW.
                    WINONA
          What are you doing??
He begins pulling paper towels from the dispenser and
stuffing as many as he can down his shirt. Again: YELLOW.
                    WINONA
          You’ve finally lost it.
Jackie turns and looks at Winona up and down.
                       JACKIE
          Hit me.
                       WINONA
          What?

                    JACKIE
          Hit me! Hard! Make it hurt.
                    WINONA
          I’m not like you.     I don’t hit
          people.
                    JACKIE
          Exactly. I need to do something so
          unlikely that it propels me to-
          AHHH
Winona knees Jackie in the groin.

Jackie falls to the ground. He closes his eyes. The
bluetooth turns GREEN.

                       JACKIE
          Thank you.
He pushes the button, his head kicks back, he inhales deep
and stares right past Winona. He looks like he is seeing
God.
Winona is stunned. She waves her hands in front of his eyes.
                    WINONA
          Did it work? Hello? Should I do it
          harder?
                                                         71.


She winds up her fist to punch him in the groin again.
Suddenly Jackie exhales and grabs her hand.
                    JACKIE
               (perfect English)
          Winona, give me a moment. I don’t
          know how long I can maintain this
          connection.
                    WINONA
          You’re English... it’s-
                    JACKIE
               (Perfect English)
          Shhh... I know over the years, I’ve
          neglected you and taken your love
          for granted. I don’t deserve you.
          But, right now all I want in the
          whole wide world is to save our
          family and I need your help. Can
          you give me the benefit of the
          doubt one last time sweetheart?

Winona can’t help but be convinced. She nods.
Jackie presses the button, his face shudders, and he inhales
again. He has disconnected.

He stands up and approaches the door.

WRITER UNIVERSE - INT. HOME OFFICE

Jackie.Writer is sitting in a nice mid-century office with
lofted ceilings and tall windows. He sits on a bed,
surrounded by medical equipment. His thin, frail face is
white as if one of his fictional characters reached out to
him through his brain. Because that’s what happened.
His editor and partner, CHRIS, a tall sharply dressed man
whose last name is Tucker sits on the couch beside Jackie.
                    CHRIS
          Hey, what’s the hold up?
                    WRITER.JACKIE
          I think... my character just got
          into my head.
                    CHRIS
          That’s normal, right? You’ve been
          living with them for so long-
                                                         72.


                    WRITER.JACKIE
          No... literally. Jackie verse
          jumped to me here... I felt him.
                    CHRIS
          Come on, babe, you made up that
          silly sci-fi shit.
                    JACKIE
          Maybe I’ve started something I
          can’t finish... This book, its
          bigger than me...

They both look up at the bulletin board next to them. On it
there are a bunch of note cards and diagrams. There is a
diagram of two minds connected. Chris rubs his back.
                    CHRIS
          All this meta stuff’s getting into
          your head. Let’s get through this
          draft and you can take a break.
          Read that roller coaster part back
          to me again, I like that part.

Jackie shakes it off stares at his computer screen.

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR
A SWAT officer with a gas mask on pulls pins from a tear gas
canister. He throws a canister outside of the bathroom.

Another one tosses the canisters into the the ceiling vents.
                    WRITER.JACKIE (V.O.)
          "How odd it felt to know that he
          was in the safe confines of a
          predetermined path: every turn
          decided, every word written."


INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BATHROOM
Gas begins seeping in through the vents. Jackie pushes
Winona into the back of the bathroom.
He unrolls some toilet paper and begins cutting it randomly
with scissors.
                    WRITER.JACKIE (V.O.)
          "And yet, his heart beat in his
          chest like a child wanting off a
          roller coaster. In these

          situations, he remembered takings
          his frightened daughter’s hand
          years ago and saying ’this is where
          the fun is..."
As gas filters in all around them, he looks up at Winona
with a serene smile. He unfolds the toilet paper to reveal a
paper snowflake. His bluetooth device flashes GREEN.
                    JACKIE
          "This is where we scream."
He presses the button:
Jackie rapidly downloads divergent memories:

- Jackie as a child, running with scissors.
- His Mother singing to him as a child with bandages over
his eyes.

- As an older blind man, he is now singing to his elderly
mother.

OPERA UNIVERSE - INT. OPERA HOUSE

Jackie stands on a huge stage alone wearing sunglasses- now
blind. There is a huge audience before him.
A single note from the string section begins to SWELL.

SPLIT SCREEN: in unison both Jackies INHALE a large lungful
of oxygen.


INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR
As the Opera singer sings his sustained note, Jackie kicks
open the bathroom door in SLOW MOTION. Gas billows.
With his eyes closed and his breath held, he makes his way
through the gas. He grabs hold of a large trophy and uses it
to take out one of the SWAT officers wearing a mask and
holding a riot shield. He pulls off the gas mask and throws
it into the bathroom for Winona.

Another Jumper runs in with a DIY hairspray/lighter flame
thrower. Jackie senses him coming and ducks under a stream
of fire. He kicks the Jumper’s leg’s out causing him to drop
his flame thrower. Jackie uses the flame thrower to torch
the ceiling, triggering the water sprinklers.
                                                      74.


Water pours down, washing away the tear gas. Just as he
stands some one kicks him from behind. He falls.
SPLIT SCREEN: Opera Jackie’s voice falters and cracks. He
pulls away from the microphone embarrassed. Jackie gets
kicked in the head. He disconnects as he hits the
ground. But the epic opera music continue to score the
scene.
He is surrounded by Jumpers with guns and makeshift weapons
(i.e. pencil cross bows, CD throwing stars, etc).
He lands on the riot shield. He knows what to do. He grabs a
frog shaped paper weight off a nearby desk and swallows it
whole. Flashing light: GREEN! He presses the button.

We see divergent memories flash:
- Jackie gymnast falls off the high bars, his ankle breaks
- Wearing an ankle cast he watches someone else win at the
Olympics on TV.

- He is shaking hands with a new employer at a pizza shop.

SIGN SPINNER UNIVERSE - EXT. PIZZA SHOP - DAY

Jackie is wearing a Little Caesar’s uniform and spinning a
sign. He’s really good. Someone stop’s to take a selfie.


INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR
Jackie picks up the riot shield just as the Jumpers begin to
fire. He swirls the shield like a magnificent sign spinner
blocking bullets and miscellaneous sharp objects.
He runs and jumps on the shield, knocking one of the hunters
over. He kicks the shield up in the air and spins the shield
knocking all of their weapons out of their hands. He slams
the shield to the left BAM! To the right BAM! knocking more
foes over.
Meanwhile Winona emerges from the bathroom and watches her
husband do the impossible. She pulls the gas mask off in
disbelief.
Jobu stands from a distance and watches skeptically as
Jackie suddenly has become a super hero. She escapes up the
stairs.
                                                        75.


                      WINONA
          Joy wait!
Jackie looks up just as Jobu is leaving. Someone kicks
Jackie in the chest he falls backwards into the break room
kitchen.

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BREAK ROOM KITCHEN
A small frail lady comes after him wielding a fire axe like
she’s a lumberjack. She chops right through the shield.

Jackie has landed on a pile of plastic silverware. He picks
up two plastic knives and holds it up against her fire axe.

She slams the axe into the counter- its stuck!   Jackie takes
the opportunity to look through the fridge. He   pulls out a
2-liter bottle of orange soda. He pops off the   cap and
starts chugging the entire thing in one go. He   is trying to
finish it before she pulls the axe out.
He finishes the last drop: GREEN! He jumps.

The hunter dislodges the axe and swings. Jackie spins his
plastic knives and sidesteps the axe head, stabbing one
knife into the lady’s forearm. He kicks the axe out of her
hand and slides on the floor, slashing both of her Achilles
tendons. She falls to the ground.

CHEF UNIVERSE - INT. BENIHANA’S HIBACHI RESTAURANT

Jackie is an hibachi chef with incredible knife skills. He
is cooking up a storm and spinning his knives.


INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BREAKROOM KITCHEN
With chef like precision, he slices his way past three more
bounty hunters using nothing but his plastic cutlery.
A rolling chair knocks Jackie to the ground. Desmond pushes
the rolling chair into Jackie’s body, his arms and hands are
pushed up against his body and he can’t move anything except
his pinkies.
Jackie’s eyes close and the bluetooth turns GREEN. Desmond
looks down to see Jackie is caressing Desmond’s leg with his
foot.

PINKY UNIVERSE - INT. GYM

Montage: Jackie does nothing but pinky push-ups everyday of
his life. Jackie’s pinkies look like they are jacked on
steroids.

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BREAKROOM KITCHEN
Jackie’s pinkies clamp down on the chair legs breaking them.
Desmond is confused. Jackie punches the chair with his
pinkies and it sends Desmond and the chair
flying. Desmond’s bluetooths fly out his ear.
                    DESMOND
          Damnit!
His head slumps forward: he disconnects. Normal Desmond
looks up confused.
More bounty hunters attack Jackie but he disarms them with
his super powerful pinkies. He flicks one in the stomach and
guts pour out.

Desmond comes charging at him, no longer a jumper, he now
believes he’s a hero.
                    DESMOND
          Stop this madness!
Jackie ducks and punches Desmond in the leg with his pinky,
puncturing a hole in his leg, blood pours out of his leg.

                    DESMOND
          THE SAME HOLE!?
Jackie wraps his pinkies around Desmond’s head as if he’s
going to snap his neck.
                    WINONA (O.S.)
          Jackie! What are you doing?
Jackie stops and sees his wife is horrified.
                    WINONA
          Stop that! Jackie this is not who
          you are. You are a sweet old man!
                    JACKIE
          No, I’m a sweet old man who has
          been dragged into war.
                                                        77.


Desmond takes the opportunity to hit Jackie in the head.
Jackie falls over. His head is swirling. We start to hear
all of the SOUNDS AND VOICES from the other universes. They
are starting to leak through.

LEAK: Taxes Jackie is having a migraine. The Writer coughs
and takes medicine. The Singer is experiencing feedback
from his microphone. The Sign Spinner drops his sign, a
teenager points and laughs.
Desmond wraps his arms around Jackie’s neck like a Russian
cage fighter. Jackie grabs blindly at Desmond’s face.

LEAK: The Fighter is blinded by flashing cameras. The Tax
organizer sighs, depressed.

                    WINONA
          Both of you stop this!
Jackie’s face is turning purple. He looks up at Winona with
red eyes.
                    JACKIE
               (In Chinese)
          I love you.
His bluetooth flashes GREEN, but wavers Jackie jumps.

Beat.
Jackie’s fingers go limp.

                    JACKIE
          Oh no.

HOT DOG HAND UNIVERSE - APARTMENT LIVING ROOM
Jackie is sitting on a piano bench holding something in his
hot dog hands looking depressed. It’s a picture of Joy- also
with hot dog fingers.

INT. IRS 11TH FLOOR BREAKROOM KITCHEN
Jackie swipes his floppy fingers at Desmond but its useless.
                    WINONA
          Jackie! Remember what Joy used to
          say about her Hot Dog Hand
          drawings?

                    JACKIE
          If everyone has hot dogs for
          fingers... they’d use their feet.
Jackie kicks up and grabs Desmond’s face with his toes.
Desmond pulls back and swings a fist, but Jackie catches it
with his foot. His toes latch onto Desmond’s wrist and snap
it. With a flurry of final kicks, he sends Desmond flying
through the air- he’s unconscious. With his foot still in
the air, Jackie waves his toes as if to say "bye, bye".
Winona is amazed and horrified. Jackie faints into Winona.

INT. STAIRWELL - LATER

Jackie and Winona stumble into the stairwell. Jackie falls
to his knees, with a brain splitting migraine. He pulls out
his pills and begins to swallow some.

                    WINONA
          Jackie, rest. You don’t look well.
                    JACKIE
          I have one mission. I’m not going
          to fail at this too.
                    WINONA
          What if that mission gets you
          killed?
                    JACKIE
          Then at least I fulfilled my
          purpose.
                    WINONA
          What exactly is your purpose?
Jackie tries to answer but he is overcome with another head
ache. We hear the SOUNDS OF THE OTHER UNIVERSES leak in.
Jackie tries to form a coherent sentence as he flashes
through the other universes:

          First, you tried to convince me
          that we have to kill our daughter
          and now you want to talk about our
          marriage?
Jackie vomits orange soda and a frog shaped paperweight. He
wipes his mouth.

EXT. ROOFTOP - MOMENTS LATER
Jackie bursts out of the stairwell followed by Winona.

Jackie spots Jobu at the other end of the roof with her back
to them. She looms over the building.

          You know, I’ve lost track of how
          many of you I have hunted down and

          Joy, we just want to talk.
                    JACKIE
          No more talking. The only way we
          can end this is in a fight. This
          ends now.

          And here I was hoping you’d say
          something less predictable.
Jackie SNORTS A LINE OF OLD DUST from an A/C unit. It hurts.
Winona is horrified. His bluetooth turns GREEN.
He closes his eyes. He presses the button and his head
shoots back. He strikes a kung-fu pose.
Joy turns. They face off for their final battle. A breath
and then he charges.

He throws a punch, but Joy anticipates it and wraps herself
around Jackie and pulls out a phone to take a selfie. Jackie
is confused.
CAMERA FLASH:

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. LOCKER ROOM
Jackie is taking a selfie with his young opponent, MCGREGOR.
FLASH. McGregor excitedly looks at his phone.
                     MCGREGOR
          Oh man, thank you! My daughter is
          such a huge fan, she’s going to
          love this.
He holds up the phone to show to Jackie but suddenly two
fingers COME OUT OF THE PHONE and poke Jackie in the eyes-


EXT. ROOFTOP - SIMULTANEOUS
Jackie recoils as Jobu pulls back her fingers. Jackie
blindly swings at her again, but she blocks every blow.
Jackie pulls a gun from his belt. He fires, but Jobu catches
the bullet in her teeth. She transforms the bullet into a
little piece of shrimp and spits it at Jackie’s face-

CHEF UNIVERSE - INT. BENIHANA’S HIBACHI RESTAURANT
Jackie is bouncing shrimp on his knife, and tosses it at a
customer’s mouth. It hits her dress and gets sauce all over.
She angrily gets up and leaves.
                                                      82.


Jackie looks up to see the new young chef, BEEFY, cooking up
a storm and gathering a crowd. He throws three shrimps at
once and they all land in a customer’s mouth. Jackie simmers
with jealousy. He begins to walk over, but is blocked by a
leg. He trips-

EXT. ROOFTOP - SIMULTANEOUS
Jackie falls to the ground after Jobu sweep kicked him.
He picks up a broken brick and hits Jobu across the face
with it, but it bounces off like its Jello. Jackie looks
down and the brick has actually turned to Jello. He throws
it at her And she catches it. It immediately turns into a
calculator. The calculator is filled with "8"s-

TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. DINING ROOM
Jackie frustrated with his calculator. The "8" key is stuck
and he is slamming it trying to fix it.

                    JACKIE
          Why... why can’t anything be easy?
Suddenly a hand reaches out of a pile of paperwork and grabs
Jackie’s head and slams it into the table. BAM-

EXT. IRS BUILDING

Jobu is slamming Jackie’s head into the edge of the roof.
Over and over. Jackie’s face is covered in blood and dust.
                    WINONA
          Joy! Please! Stop this!
                    JACKIE
          Why are you doing this?
                    JOBU
          I’m trying to show you something.
With every slam, we see Jackie is in another universe for a
flash: Taxes Jackie having a migraine and taking medication,
Chef Jackie burning himself on his stove etc.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. LOCKER ROOM

Jackie falls back and catches himself on a bench.
                    MCGREGOR
          Easy there. We still got to fight
          tonight.
               (leans in)
          Don’t worry, man, I’ll make sure it
          looks real painful when I go down
          in the third round. Just tell your
          agents next time we do this, I get
          to win, okay?
McGregor gives Jackie a wink and a pat on the shoulder as he
exits. Jackie has no idea what he’s talking about.
                    JACKIE
          What was he talking about?
                    AGENT
          We thought it would be better for
          the show if you didn’t know-

                    JACKIE
          This whole thing is rigged? You
          don’t think I can actually beat
          him.
                    AGENT
          Jackie... you’re just an actor.
          It’s for your own safety-


EXT. IRS BUILDING
Jackie pulls away from Jobu’s grasp.
                    JACKIE
          Its all... fake.
                     JOBU
          There you go, now we’re getting
          somewhere.
                    JACKIE
          No... no that doesn’t matter. None
          of the other universes matter.
                    JOBU
          Are you sure? Maybe this universe
          doesn’t matter and you should focus
          on that shrimp problem? Is this

          universe any more important than
          any other? Do they all matter?
                    JACKIE
          No... no, because there’s one with
          hot dogs fingers. How could that
          one matter? It makes no sense.
                    JOBU
          I’m sure that Jackie would say the
          same thing if he saw your life.
Jackie falls back down in pain. His headache is reaching new
levels.
                    JACKIE
               (through his teeth)
          Get out. Of my. Head. Stop messing
          with my other lives.
                    JOBU
          Dad, I’m just a small part of the
          universe’s slow march towards
          entropy-

his computer.

          I don’t have any more control than
          you do. But you already know this
          don’t you?
She picks up Linus her cat and shakes him. He becomes a
thick stack of papers.
          JACKIE                           JOBU
What are you talking about?        (simultaneous)
Hey what is that? How do         "What are you talking
you know what I’m going to       about? Hey what is that?
say- Stop that. Now.             How do you know what I’m

She is reading from the stack of papers. It’s a manuscript.

                    JOBU
          "Jackie shakes his head in
          disbelief. He recognizes the

          Understands what?-

WRITER’S UNIVERSE - INT. OFFICE
Jackie.Writer falls onto his couch, Chris his editor runs in
to discover that the office has been ransacked. Papers are
everywhere, the desk is overturned, and the bulletin board
is missing all of the note cards. Jackie is disoriented.
                    CHRIS
          Calm down. Tell me what happened?
He holds Jackie.Writer’s face.
                    JACKIE
               (rambling)
          I wrote a scene where she stole
          what I wrote and is reading what I
          wrote back to me.
                    CHRIS
          Goddammit Jackie, why do you always
          do this to your stories?
                    JACKIE
          I know... its contrived and
          cheap... but I had to do it.
               (horrified)
          I was compelled.

EXT. ROOFTOP - SIMULTANEOUS

Winona is holding Jackie’s face. She wipes the sweat off his
forehead with her sleeve.
                    JOBU
          Finding a universe where another
          version of you is writing
          everything that is happening here.
          It’s just so... stupid.
                    JACKIE
          Its not stupid, it worked.
                    JOBU
          Well I think that’s what scares me
          most about you.
               (leans in, almost captivated)
          You’re the first Jackie to grasp
          just how stupid it all really is.
                                                         86.


                    WINONA
          What is she talking about?
Jackie collapses into Winona’s arms. His temperature is
rising, his eyelids blink rapidly, drool rushes from his
mouth. We can hear a glitchy remix of the OTHER UNIVERSES.
Jobu stands, disappointed.
                    JOBU
          You’re close, but no pineapple.
               (catching herself)
          I’m sorry. It’s hard to keep track
          of which idioms come from which
          verses. Anyways, you’re not the One
          I’m looking for.
She turns away. She picks up Linus and prepares to go.
                    JACKIE (O.S.)
          Wait.
Jackie grits his teeth and stands up. It’s almost heroic,
except for the fact that his eyes are crossed and he is
unsteady as a drunk.
                    JACKIE
          So what if this universe doesn’t
          matter more than another.
Jobu turns intrigued.

Jackie takes a step forward, a hand grabs him-

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - STADIUM

Jackie is walking through the crowd towards the fighting
ring. He is spun around by someone in the crowd. It’s
Winona. Jackie melts.
                    JACKIE
          You’re still here.
                    WINONA
          Jackie! I can’t stay. I need to
          leave for the airport in 20
          minutes.
Jackie is heartbroken. The masses all watch in confusion.
Who is this women he is talking to?
                                                      87.

                    AGENT
          Jackie! Get in that fucking ring!
Jackie hesitates. He comes up with an idea.
                    JACKIE
               (to Winona)
          Don’t leave. I’ll be right back.

                    WINONA
          What about your fight?

He looks up at McGregor. Jackie clenches his fist.
                    JACKIE
          If you need to leave in 20 minutes,
          then I’ll end the fight in 5.
He runs off-


EXT. ROOFTOP - SIMULTANEOUS
Jackie takes another step, Jobu takes a step back. For the
first time in long time Jobu actually seems interested.
Maybe even excited.
Jackie takes another step-

SIGN SPINNER UNIVERSE - INT. OFFICE
Jackie is packing up his uniform and his sign about to go.
He looks back into the office, he slips a sharpie into his
pocket and smiles to himself.


CHEF UNIVERSE - INT. BENIHANA’S HIBACHI RESTAURANT
Jackie is standing across from the Young Beefy chef.
Everyone around them is chanting: "Cook off! Cook off! Cook
off!"
Jackie approaches him with confidence-

EXT. ROOFTOP - SIMULTANEOUS

Jackie scoops up the helmet device meant to kill Jobu and
takes another step.
Jobu takes another step back and bumps up against the edge
of the roof. The look on her face is thrilled.
                                                         88.


                    JOBU
          How are you doing this? How do you
          still give a fuck?
                    JACKIE
               (through his teeth)
          Watch your language.

PINKY UNIVERSE - INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE
Jackie has his arms around the neck of the doctor, with his
strong Pinky up against his head like a gun. Nurses try to
calm him down.
                    JACKIE
          I said nobody move! I’m not leaving
          here until someone promises to fix
          my pinkies. Right here! Right now!
To prove his strength he flicks a doorway with his pinkie
and splinters fly everywhere. Everyone backs away-


TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. DINING ROOM
Jackie stands with his hands on the table. Winona is a
little scared.
                    JACKIE
          We are not getting a divorce
          because we made a sacred vow. You
          are my wife and I am yours. We are
          meant to be together forever. This
          is how much I love you.
Winona is a little touched.


EXT. ROOFTOP - SIMULTANEOUS
Jackie has reached Jobu. She is enraptured.
                    JOBU
          I’ve seen so many minds crumble
          under that weight. What are you
          still holding onto?
                    JACKIE
          You think nothing matters.
                                                      89.


                    JOBU
          I’ve seen it.
                    JACKIE
          Everything matters.
Jackie slowly places the helmet on her head. He turns the
helmet on. Jobu nods slowly, almost begging for it.
                    JOBU
               (tearing up)
          That’s so stupid. But it’s working.
          Am I going to be free?
                    WINONA
          No!!
                    JOBU
          Do it, Dad.
He turns the knob. An electrical shock shoots through the
helmet. The blast knocks Jackie off his feet. Joy’s eyes
roll back. It’s working, her consciousness is being fried in
every universe.
And then it stops. Everything goes quiet. Joy falls to the
ground. She is gone.

Jackie’s eyes roll back and he collapses to the ground.
Music begins to gently play as if its the end of the movie.
Jackie falls into Winona’s arms. She is so confused. Jackie
looks up from Joy to Winona
                    JACKIE
          Please, remember me like this. As a
          hero.
                    WINONA
          But... but... but...
Jackie’s eyes also roll back. He is flashing rapidly through
universes. And then he is limp. He’s died... a hero.
                    WINONA
               (through tears)
          This is so stupid.

CUT TO BLACK: THE END

CREDITS:

Between the TITLE CARDS during above-the-line credits
sequence, we see alternate endings from other universes. Its
disorienting and Jackie is lost in the moments.

ENDING 1: EXT IRS ROOFTOP
An electrical shock shoots through the helmet. The blast
knocks Jackie off his feet. Joy falls to the ground.
Beat. And then Jobu suddenly sits up again. She wipes away
her tears and shakes it off laughing.
                     JOBU
           Man, for a second there I really
           thought... hah! I haven’t felt
           anything like that in awhile!

                     JACKIE
           Joy? Is that you? Did I fix you?
                     JOBU
           You didn’t do a damn thing.
Jobu picks up a teapot and pulls a trigger. The teapot
shoots Jackie and then Winona. They both fall dead.


ENDING 2: EXT IRS ROOFTOP
An electrical shock shoots through the helmet. The blast
knocks Jackie off his feet. Joy falls to the ground.
Jackie’s eyes roll back and he collapses into Winona’s arms.

                     JACKIE
           Did we do it...?
Winona pulls off a rubber mask. She is actually Jobu.
                     JOBU
           Nope. Infinity is one tricksy
           bitch.
                     JACKIE
           Huh?

Jackie dies.

ENDING 3: EXT IRS ROOFTOP
Jobu falls to the ground, she’s gone.
Jackie turns to Winona. Winona’s head goes limp and cocks
back up again. It’s Alpha Winona.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          It’s me. Alpha Winona.
                    JACKIE
          But I saw you die.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          I did die in your universe, but I
          survived in another because the
          multiverse-
                    JACKIE
          STOP! Stop it! I don’t want to know
          anymore.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          I’m sorry, but we think her
          consciousness managed to survive
          the shock from the device so now...
Jackie falls back exasperated and dies, AGAIN.

ENDING 4: EXT IRS ROOFTOP

                    ALPHA WINONA
          ...her consciousness managed to
          survive the shock from the device
          so now-
Jackie’s head goes limp. His head lifts up again. He has a
different demeanor. It’s Alpha Jackie.
                    ALPHA JACKIE
          I know. Although it appeared that
          we’d killed her in an infinite
          number of universes, there was
          another infinite number where she
          survived.
                    ALPHA WINONA
          Alpha Jackie? But you-
                    ALPHA JACKIE
          I died, I know. But that was in
          your Alphaverse. In my Alphaverse,
          I’ve been watching over you, love.

They hold each other about to kiss. The camera pushes into
his head.


ALPHA.VERSE B - INT. CONTROL ROOM
Jackie is sitting in the seat where Alpha Winona usually
sits.
                    OFFICER
          Are you sure this is a good idea,
          testing the laws of causality like
          this? Sir?
Jackie looks around suddenly aware. This is no longer Alpha
Jackie. This is our Jackie.
                    JACKIE
          Wait... what?

SCROLLING CREDITS:

As the main credits begin to scroll, a smaller frame
continues to show Jackie’s journey through the infinite
possibilities.


EXT. IRS ROOFTOP
Jackie sits up surrounded by Medics and Police.

                    JACKIE
          What’s going on?
He looks across the roof and spots Winona next to Joy who is
sitting up on a stretcher looking shell shocked as well.
                    JOY
          ... I don’t know what happened...
          where am I?
                    JACKIE
          Don’t trust her! She’s lying!
                    POLICE
          Sir, you have the right to remain
          silent...
A Policeman slams Jackie down and handcuffs him. Winona runs
over to Jackie and begins wailing on him.
                                                       93.


                    WINONA
          You tried to kill her!   Your own
          daughter.
                    POLICE
          Someone restrain her!
Jackie shields himself from the blows-

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT STADIUM
Suddenly, Jackie’s face is bruised and battered.   McGregor
has him grappled into the corner of the ring.
                    MCGREGOR
               (through his teeth)
          This was supposed to be light, fun.
          You fucking punch me as hard as you
          can, of course I’m going to punch
          back. I’ll destroy you, old man!
Jackie pushes with all his might to twist out-


PINKY UNIVERSE - INT. HOSPITAL
Jackie is now grappling with his arm around the Doctor. He
is surrounded by security guards trying to calm him down.
                    JACKIE
          I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I don’t know
          what’s happening...
                    DOCTOR
          It’s okay just calm down. It
          doesn’t have to go down like this.
          There is a better way.
The security guards step forward. Jackie steps back through
a door-

CHEF UNIVERSE - INT. BENIHANA’S KITCHEN
Jackie pushes through the kitchen door and is shocked by
what he sees.
The Beefy Chef has taken off his chef’s hat and sitting on
his head is a Raccoon pulling his hair. It’s RACACOONIE, the
talking, cooking raccoon.
                                                        94.


Racacoonie and Beefy are singing a Randy Newman style song
about friendship. Racaccoonie will be voiced by Randy
Newman.
                     BEEFY
                (sung)
          ... because without you, we’d never
          do...
                    RACACOONIE
               (sung)
          Whatever you’re cooking up, I’m
          cooking- AHHHHH!!
                       JACKIE
          AHHHHHH!
                    BEEFY
          Please... I’m begging you. You
          can’t tell anyone.
Racaccoonie drops the hair and Beefy’s hands flop to his
side.

                    RACACOONIE
          Of course he’s going to rat on us,
          he’s been jealous of us ever since
          we walked into the kitchen.
                    BEEFY
          Now is not the time, Raccaccoonie!

Jackie shakes his head in disbelief as he turns but knocks
over a big bag of potatoes-

HERO UNIVERSE - EXT. ROOFTOP
Potatoes tumble out of a SWAT members uniform.

                    SWAT OFFICER
          He turned Connors into potatoes!
                       SWAT OFFICER #2
          Open Fire!
Rapid Succession: Jackie   is shot in the head. But then the
screen splits. And he is   shot again in the shoulder. Split:
he is shot in the chest.   Split: the bullets all miss him
miraculously. We stay in   this universe, the others slide
away.
                                                         95.

We cut out from Jackie’s perspective and he is squirming,
and tumbling. From the SWAT team’s perspective, he is
dodging every bullet-


WRITER UNIVERSE - INT. OFFICE
Jackie is squirming on the couch muttering incoherently,
Chris is fanning him with a magazine.
                    CHRIS
          You gotta stop writing. Rest!
                    JACKIE
               (perfect English)
          Therein lies the problem. Here on
          the couch, I have stopped, but I am
          also over there- writing away...
We see another Jackie is rapidly typing on a computer.
                    JACKIE
          And the scary thing is I can type
          whatever nonsense I can think of
          and I know that somewhere out
          there, it exists. It’s real.
                    CHRIS
          Babe, what are you talking about?
The Jackie at the computer announces as he types.

                    JACKIE
          Spaghetti. Noodle. Baby. Boy.
We hear the sound of water BOILING-


SPAGHETTI UNIVERSE - BOILING POT
Jackie is a long strand of spaghetti. He is in a pot with a
lot of other strands of spaghetti. One little elbow noodle
approaches him. He will be voiced by a small child. This is
SPAGHETTI NOODLE BABY BOY.
                    SPAGHETTI NOODLE BABY BOY
          Daddy! Daddy! It’s finally here!
          Throwing Day! Do you think they’ll
          choose me? I hope I’m ready. Do you
          think I’ll stick on the wall?

Noodle Jackie looks at his round little son who looks
completely different from all of the other noodles. He’s a
macaroni, all of the noodles are spaghetti.
                                                      96.


                    NOODLE JACKIE
          I don’t know, Spaghetti Baby Noodle
          Boy...
                    SPAGHETTI BABY NOODLE BOY
               (distraught)
          If they don’t choose me, how will I
          become a man? Dad, do you not
          believe I will stick??
Jackie tries to wrestle himself away, but the spaghetti all
around him binds with him-

HERO UNIVERSE - INT. IRS OFFICE.

Jackie has spaghetti flowing from his sleeves. Everyone is
trying to restrain him but he is too noodley,
Jackie falls to the ground and comes face to face with the
Watermelon with the hole in it.


TAPIR UNIVERSE - EXT. FOREST
Jackie is a Tapir Pig and he is staring at a watermelon like
it’s a black hole.

                     BABY PIG
          Daddy?   Please daddy, we’re hungry!
Jackie’s family of Tapir pigs stand behind him. His Pig Wife
approaches. The pigs can talk. Like Babe.
                    PIG WIFE
          Honey, what has gotten into
          you? We Tapir’s have been doing
          this for generations. The women
          rear the children, they protect the
          herd. And the men, you have one
          job. Providing us nourishment.
Jackie Pig backs away.
                    JACKIE PIG
          No... I won’t. I can’t.
                    PIG WIFE
          Jackie, God would not have given
          Tapir pigs prehensile penis’s if he
          didn’t want you to juice that
          watermelon.
                                                      97.


                    JACKIE PIG
          I’ll find food for us. There has to
          be a better way.
                    BABY PIG
          But, I’m so hungry...
CLOSE UP ON JACKIE’S EYES: We rapidly flash through several
universes. The CAUCOPHONY of sounds and voices of all of the
universes begin to mix together. His eyes close.
                    JACKIE
          Shut up! Everyone SHUT UP!!
Silence. And then:


HERO UNIVERSE - EXT. IRS BUILDING
Jackie slowly opens his eyes. He is outside of the IRS
Building. The place is a mess of random objects:
watermelons, cooking supplies, pizza boxes, etc. Everyone is
cautiously making their way towards him.

                    WINONA
          Jackie... please, let me help you-
                    JACKIE
          Shhhh! Not now!
He holds his breath, tries not to move or think...

The moment he inhales, the screen fractures into two, one in
which he is inhaling, and another in which he exhales.
                    JACKIE
               (on thin ice)
          Oh... oh no...
Both versions of him look right, but as he does so, the
screen fractures again, showing that he also looked left in
both universes. There are now four different Jackies.
                    FOUR JACKIES SIMULTANEOUSLY
          Shit/Fuck/Aiyahhh/No, no, no...
All four images split exponentially across the screen- 8 to
16 to 32 to a million- exploding like a shock wave. The
rapidly multiplying images of universes swallow the
SCROLLING CREDIT TEXT like a disease, overtaking the screen.

THE FLOODGATES HAVE OPENED
                                                      98.


THE REMAINING CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL THROUGH THE BACKGROUND.

In rapid succession, we pull out from his face over and over
again, each time he is in a different universe, but his
expression is always the same: He’s sitting in the IRS
cubicle. He’s underwater, screaming as bubbles flow from his
lips. He’s running from a stampede of bulls. He’s sitting on
a bus screaming as other passengers avert their gaze. He’s
tied to a stake, actually on fire. He is random objects: a
rock, a burger, a black hole, an orbital sander Etc, etc.
And then it all goes quiet. Jackie is himself. He floats
through an endless tunnel of universes organized like office
cubicles, above and below, and on either side. Like the
trippy space sequence from 2001: A Space Odyssey, except
instead of abstract light and shapes, its endless cubicles.
We cut to Jackie’s face. He is no longer screaming or in
pain. He just stares blankly. Outside the IRS building, its
all chaos around him, random objects from different
intersecting universes. But he is calm.
END CREDITS


ON BLACK:
TITLE: "PART 2: EVERYWHERE"

HOT DOG UNIVERSE - INT. CAR

Jackie’s eyes are shut tight. He is pulled over on the side
of the road. Sweat drips down his face as he
hyperventilates. He opens his eyes. The chaos is over. The
anxiety begins to pass.

He lifts his hands up: he has hot dogs for fingers. He is
wearing a tuxedo and his hair’s slicked back. A foot lifts
up and shifts the car into gear. He drives away. Though this
all comes naturally for his body, his eyes look around as if
they are being controlled by someone else. He is still lost.

HOT DOG UNIVERSE - EXT. CHAPEL
Jackie exits the car and sees a small crowd of other people
also dressed nicely, also with hot dogs for fingers. One
elderly lady comes up to him and pats him on the back with
her sloppy fingers.
                                                         99.


                    ELDERLY LADY
          Congratulations! Oh, you must be so
          happy.
Unsure of what she is talking about, Jackie just nods.
                    WEDDING PLANNER (O.S.)
          Oh, there you are!
A lady dressed in a smart dress suit with a clipboard
resting on her floppy fingers approaches Jackie.
                    WEDDING PLANNER
          Come on, everyone’s waiting!

HOT DOG UNIVERSE - INT. CHAPEL SIDE ROOM
Jackie enters and he sees a bride with her back turned
getting ready. She turns: It’s Joy.
                    JOY
          Oh Daddy! See I told you not to
          worry, he’s always late.
Joy reaches over to give Jackie a hug but he recoils and
holds up his hands to fight her.

                    JACKIE
          You’re supposed to be dead!
Everyone stares Jackie.

                    WINONA
          Jackie... you promised you wouldn’t
          cause trouble today. Please...

Joy cocks her head to the side.   There is a moment of
recognition.

                    JOY
               (acting)
          Oh, dad, you always get like this
          when you’re nervous. Come on let me
          get you a drink-
She ushers him away.
                                                     100.


HOT DOG UNIVERSE - INT. BATHROOM

Joy is staring at Jackie. She is looking for something.
                    JOY
          It happened to you, didn’t it?
                    JACKIE
          What did you do to me?
                    JOY
          You’re everywhere, aren’t you?

                    JACKIE
          I don’t know. What’s that mean?

Joy comes up to her dad and holds him by the shoulder.
                    JOY
               (sweet)
          Dad... you’re like me.
She hugs him. The moment she does, they cycle through a
dozen universes where they are also hugging like a spinning
slot machine.
Jackie pulls back.

                    JACKIE
          No I’m not anything like you.
          You’re... evil. I had to kill you
          to stop you...

                    JOY
          Come on, dad. You sound so
          dramatic. "Evil" is so relative.

                    JACKIE
          Don’t say that. There is a right
          and there is a wrong. And I’ve seen
          you do wrong things. So many.
As Joy speaks we rhythmically cycle through random universes
where they both happen to be speaking.
We stop in the Temple Universe where Jobu’s Followers live.
Jackie looks up at shrines built for Jobu. She is taking
care of children and curing illnesses. A gilded banner
reads: "Cherish and Protect our Merciful Empress."
                    JOY
          I know I must have looked like pure
          evil from your limited perspective,
                    (MORE)
                                                      101.

                    JOY (cont’d)
          but I’m also a real saint in other
          universes. You gotta see all of me,
          Dad. We’re literally in an infinite
          number of places right now. You’re
          doing terrible things too.
                    JACKIE
          No, I’m not like you!
There is KNOCK on the door.
                    WEDDING PLANNER (O.S.)
          Joy! Everyone’s ready to go!
                    JOY
          Just one second!
               (hushed)
          Look, dad. Whether you like it not,
          everything is happening everywhere
          all at once. Eventually you’ll
          learn there’s only one thing to do:
          take all of the noise and
          contradictions and just go numb.
          Today, for instance, I didn’t want
          a big wedding, but Becky did. So
          I’m just gonna not give a shit and
          go with the flow. It makes it way
          more bearable. Just try to do that
          for me on my special day?
                    JACKIE
          You’re wrong. You’re just young and
          don’t understand.
Joy laughs as she adjusts her veil in the mirror.
                    JOY
          Look, if you find there’s real
          purpose in any version of life
          please let me know. But don’t get
          your hopes up.
                    JACKIE
          Okay.
                    JOY
          What?
                    JACKIE
          Okay. I will show you, my daughter,
          how sweet life can-
He opens the door to leave, but the moment he does-
                                                         102.

TAX UNIVERSE - INT. CHAN APARTMENT
Jackie looks around at his apartment. It is somehow more
depressing than he remembered.

He glances over at his aging father in the wheelchair who is
staring at him because his TV show is on commercial break.
                    JACKIE
          Don’t say a word. I know what
          you’re thinking.
His dad says nothing.   He just coughs up some phlegm.

                    JACKIE
          I know you’re disappointed. Like
          Winona. Like Joy. But I will
          finally turn that around right now.
          I’m going to-
The commercial break is over.   His dad turns back to the TV.
Jackie plops down in his chair, picks up the first receipt.

                    JACKIE
               (chipper, determined)
          Okay, so if I spent $3,250 on
          printing these books in 2011...

Jackie looks up at his shelf where a stack of dusty copies
of his Self-help book he self published lie. His face smiles
at him from the cover.

                    JACKIE
          That’s a loss for 2011. But I did
          sell 3 copies in 2012 so-
As he picks up another receipt of sales it gets blown away
by the wind-
HERO UNIVERSE: The wind blows debris by Jackie who is hiding
in the bushes. He can see SWAT Officers sweeping the area
looking for him.
TAXES UNIVERSE: Jackie shakes it off and doubles down.
                    JACKIE
          So if I made a profit that year,
          then it technically constitutes as
          a business for the next few years-

HERO UNIVERSE: Jackie can see Winona being questioned and
distraught. He shakes his head trying to get himself to
focus-
                                                        103.

TAXES UNIVERSE: Jackie splashes water on his face in the
kitchen sink.
He sits back down. And starts typing away on his calculator.

                    JACKIE
          So if we add it all up then we can
          deduct an extra... $22.
Jackie deflates.
A SCREAM from the television. Jackie looks from his
paperwork over to the IRS Parking Lot-

HERO UNIVERSE: Desmond now has his arms around Winona’s
neck. He holds a gun to her head.

                    DESMOND
          Mr. Chan! Come out, this ends now!
                     SWAT OFFICER
          Sir, please calm down. We will deal
          with this.

TAXES UNIVERSE: Jackie rolls his eyes, annoyed. But he
finally gives in. He drops the calculator-


HERO UNIVERSE - EXT. IRS BUILDING
Jackie emerges from the bushes. Everyone points their
weapons in his direction.

                    JACKIE
          Let her go!
Jackie charges Desmond.

                    WINONA
          Jackie! Stop it! Please. Just stop
          it. I don’t want to see anymore
          people get hurt.
Jackie then takes one small step forward. Everyone takes a
step back. Desmond presses the gun into Winona. She yelps.
                      DESMOND
          Back off!
                    JACKIE
          I’m just trying to fix things-

He steps closer, but Desmond panics, he fires. Winona is
shot.
                                                        104.


                    JACKIE
          NO!
Before Jackie can fully react we swoop sideways into an
alternate universe-
ALTERNATE: Jackie takes a step forward. Everyone takes a
step back. Desmond presses the gun into Winona. She yelps.
Jackie angrily rips a sign pole out of the ground and throws
it through Desmond’s chest. He falls to the ground.
                    WINONA
          Jackie no. HOW COULD YOU?! You...
          You.. monster!
                    JACKIE
          But-
Again, we swoop into another alternate-
ALTERNATE: Desmond presses the gun into Winona. She yelps.
                    DESMOND
          Mr. Chan, Give up. There is only
          one way this can end.
Jackie hesitates.

TAX UNIVERSE: Jackie feels overwhelmed. The paperwork seems
to be encroaching in on him. His Father laughs at the TV.
CHEF UNIVERSE: Jackie stands at his hibachi station alone.
His food is on fire. The crowd surrounds Beefy and their
boss pats him on the back. Raccacoonie lifts up the Chef hat
just enough to mouth "fuck you".
PIG UNIVERSE: Jackie Pig comes out from the woods covered in
sticks and leaves, and cuts all over. His family waits
expectantly. He can’t even look at them. He has failed.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE: Jackie is on the ground. The crowd is
laughing at him The BELL RINGS: end of Round 1. He looks up
at Winona, she can’t even look at him.
HOT DOG UNIVERSE: Jackie watches as Joy kisses her wife
during the ceremony. She gives him an I told you so look.
TAXES UNIVERSE: He swipes all of the paperwork to the
ground.

But the camera pans up to reveal the papers are also still
perfectly stacked on the table, because in another universe
he never swiped them. He tries again, and again: no use. He
throws them in the air. Instead of dropping, they float to
the ceiling.

HERO UNIVERSE - EXT. IRS BUILDING
Jackie sees Linus the cat on the ground. He picks him up and
fluffs him: Linus becomes a pillow. Desmond looks confused.
Jackie slowly pushes the cat pillow against Desmond’s face
suffocating him as he thrashes.
                    WINONA
          What are you doing?!
In another universe: he is playing thumb wars with Desmond.
He is combing Desmond’s mustache. He is piercing Desmond’s
ear with a piercing gun. He is hugging Desmond.
TAXES UNIVERSE: Jackie looks up at the floating papers. He
smiles-
Jackie is back in the universe where he is suffocating
Desmond with a pillow. He turns his head calmly to Winona.

                    JACKIE
          Everything.
A look of horror spreads across Winona’s face. He’s gone.

                    WINONA

          -You’re drunk, I don’t think you
          should-
Jackie pushes Winona away. He has just snatched the
microphone from the maid of honor mid-speech. He takes swig
of whiskey.
                    JACKIE
          It’s my daughter’s wedding, I get
          to do whatever I want-

OPERA UNIVERSE: Jackie.Opera is singing "Everybody Was Kung
Fu Fighting" except he is just screaming the "HUH!" punch
sound from the song over and over again and causing feedback

only using his Pinkies.

          ... I always dreamed of this day...
          walking her down the aisle, dancing
          with my daughter... looking forward
          to grandchildren... you know, the
          things that dads want.
Joy nervously looks at her wife.

                    JACKIE
          So when my daughter told me she was
          a gay, I was very upset. I couldn’t
          understand it. How did I raise my
          daughter like this?
Guests all begin to whisper. Winona buries her face.
                    JOY
          Okay Dad. That’s enough.
                    JACKIE
          No! I’m trying to say something
          honest to you, just listen!

NOODLE UNIVERSE - INT. BOILING POT
                    JACKIE.SPAGHETTI
          You’re not going to stick spaghetti
          baby noodle boy! Never. You’re a
          completely different kind of pasta
          with a completely different cooking
          time. So there’s no point in
          trying!
Baby Noodle Spaghetti Boy goes limp in the pot.

WRITER UNIVERSE - INT. HOME OFFICE
Jackie shoves Chris off of him.

                    JACKIE.WRITER
          I don’t need a back massage from my
          nagging husband right now! I need
          someone who will help me fix this
          story. If you’re just going to hold
          me back, just go!

This really hurts Chris.

CHEF UNIVERSE - INT. RESTAURANT
Raccacoonie is running around the restaurant while people
are chasing him.
Jackie is on the phone.

          Yes, I’m calling about a rodent
          problem.

HOT DOG UNIVERSE - INT. WEDDING BARN

                    JACKIE
          But now I see that the world is
          very big and very stupid. We should
          do whatever we want. People fall in
          love with all sorts of things. Why
          not two girls fall in love? Why not
          two shoes? Why can’t I love this
          fruit?
Jackie looks tenderly at a edible arrangement watermelon
filled with fruit.
                    JACKIE
               (to watermelon)
          I love this beautiful fruit.   I
          love you fruit.
He unzips his pants. The crowd stares in stunned silence.

          Jackie, I have to go.
                    JACKIE
          Okay.
Jackie’s coldness hurts her. She turns before she goes.

                    WINONA
          You know. I’ve spent the last 40
          years asking myself "what if?". I
          guess I should thank you for
          answering that question.
Jackie doesn’t say anything. Just stares past her.


TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. CHAN APARTMENT
Winona looks at the mess Jackie has made.

ROCK UNIVERSE - EXT. FIELD

Jackie is a rock in a field. He stares past everything.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT STADIUM
Jackie watches as Winona slowly walks away from him. She
weaves her way through the crowd. Jackie leans his body up
against the cage. His bruised and sweaty face heaves with
his breath.
He watches as Winona gets smaller and smaller.
                    JACKIE.FIGHTER
               (whispered to himself)
          Okay. I’ll say something.
               (spits on the ground)
          Want to know what would have
          happened? "What if?"

MONTAGE - VARIOUS UNIVERSES

TAXES UNIVERSE: Winona sits on the ground surrounded by
Jackie’s mess.
                    JACKIE (V.O.)
          We’d wake up everyday in a tiny
          apartment over a failing
          laundromat...

One of the family portraits lays on the ground beside her.
                    JACKIE (V.O.)
          We’d have a daughter we wanted to
          give everything to, but would only
          push her away...
HOT DOG UNIVERSE: Jackie is drunkenly slumped at a piano
still holding the watermelon edible arrangement. His naked
leg lifts into the frame and his toes begin to gently play a
piano ballad.
MUSIC CUE: RANDY NEWMAN - "PRETTY BOY"
                    JACKIE (V.O.)
          And then there’d be us.
TAXES UNIVERSE: Jackie and Winona look at each other unable
to speak.
                                                     110.


                    JACKIE (V.O.)
          Keeping our heads high, pretending
          we know what we’re doing. But
          really just running around in
          circles. Doing laundry or trying to
          finish our taxes. Doing everything
          except what we want to be doing.
WRITER UNIVERSE: Jackie.Writer doesn’t even look up as Chris
puts his coat on and slams the door on his way out.
                    JACKIE.FIGHTER
          I used to think the whole world was
          against us. But now I see that’s
          not true. The world doesn’t care.

TAXES UNIVERSE: Winona picks up the divorce papers and
places them next to Jackie with a pen.
                    JACKIE (V.O.)
          So whenever you wonder why I don’t
          say anything, its because its
          usually better that I don’t.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE: Jackie has lost all sight of Winona in the
crowd.
CHEF UNIVERSE: Jackie looks away as Raccacoonie is carried
away in a cage by an Animal Control employee. Beefy is being
held back by other employees.
Raccacoonie begins singing along to "Pretty Boy" by Randy
Newman. His morose voice can be heard through all of the
other universes.
                    RACCACOONIE
               (singing)
          We have a tough guy here...
NOODLE UNIVERSE: Spaghetti Baby Noodle Boy is sinking to the
bottom of the pot by himself. It is dark down there, and he
is alone.
                     RACCACOONIE
               (singing)
          Please, don’t hurt no one
          tonight...
PIG UNIVERSE: Jackie Pig is dead behind the eyes. The whole
family is watching. He lifts his body up onto the
watermelon. The Pig Children all squeal with joy.
                                                     111.


                    RACCACOONIE
               (singing)
          Please, don’t hurt no woman’s
          heart...

TAXES UNIVERSES: Jackie presses the pen up against the
divorce papers but hesitates. The ink bleeds from the
pressure.
                    RACCACOONIE
               (singing)
          How about it you little prick...
          how about it...
The MUSIC EXPLODES INTO A FURIOUS CACOPHONY:

FIGHTER UNIVERSE: Jackie looks down to see a small puddle of
water and sweat, and he can see his reflection. He punches
the ground, over and over. The audience is frightened.
TAXES UNIVERSE: Jackie flips the table and throws everything
to the floor.

OPERA UNIVERSE: Jackie.Singer is on his knees screaming into
a microphone. No one is there to listen.
PINKY UNIVERSE: Jackie sits on the top of the building with
his doctor. His pinkies look infected. He bawls like a baby.
HOTDOG UNIVERSE: Jackie’s pants sit by his ankles.
Watermelon juice hits the floor. The wedding guests are
horrified. Joy shakes her head with an understanding grimace
as guests scream in horror.
HERO UNIVERSE: Desmond still holds Winona hostage. Everyone
is yelling: but it all feels distant and out of focus.

Music Fades.
He closes his eyes:

ROCK UNIVERSE - EXT. FIELD
Jackie is a rock. Sitting in the grass by a babbling brook.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          This is nice.
Beside him is another Rock. It’s Joy.

                    JOY ROCK
          This is one of my favorites places
          to exist.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          Everything feels so far away.
                     JOY ROCK
          Exactly.
We hear DISTANT ECHOES of the other
universes. Arguing. Gunfire. Booing.       Police Sirens.

Jackie and Joy sit there as rocks watching the other
universes in peace.

HOT DOG UNIVERSE: Joy gently wipes the mascara tears off her
bride’s cheeks. Becky collapses into Joy’s arms and they
hold each other on the dance floor with floppy hot dog
fingers. Joy whispers into her ear. They both break out in
laughter.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          You really care about her, don’t
          you? I’m sorry about your wedding.
                    JOY ROCK
               (laughs)
          Whatever, it’s all just random
          events organized in ways that you
          can assign meaning to.

                    JACKIE ROCK
          I’m still sorry about what I
          randomly did to your edible
          arrangement.

                    JOY ROCK
               (sigh)
          It’s fine. I’ve done plenty of
          things I told myself I’d never do.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          You’ve defiled a watermelon?
                    JOY ROCK
          Of course. But that wasn’t the
          thing that broke me.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          What was it?
                                                     113.


                    JOY ROCK
          Sigh... I dunno. There’s a universe
          where I... married a doctor.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          Really? That’s it?
Joy Rock lifts up a small picture frame with a family
portrait in it: Joy with a sweet looking man and two kids.
                       JACKIE ROCK
          Beautiful.

                    JOY ROCK
          Yeah. He’s Chinese. He went to
          Yale. We have kids. It’s one of the
          few universes where you are proud
          of me. It’s everything I wanted to
          avoid...
Another serene moment passes. The stream glistens. A leaf
falls from a tree.

                       JACKIE ROCK
          I’m sorry.
                    JOY ROCK
          Dad. Don’t apologize, I don’t have
          feelings. I’m a rock.
                    JACKIE ROCK
          I just wanted the best for you. And
          I knew that if you were really a
          gay, life was going to be very
          hard. And, it made me feel
          powerless- oh wow its so much
          easier to say these things when
          you’re a rock.
                    JOY ROCK
          Stop calling me "a gay". It’s just
          "gay".
                    JACKIE ROCK
          Okay, my gay. I know its pointless.
          But it still feels good to say.
                    WINONA (V.O.)
          I’m still glad you said something.
Jackie Rock turns towards the sound. It’s Winona in the
Fighter Universe:

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. STADIUM

Jackie turns in shock to find that Winona is still standing
right next to him. He looks from the Winona next to him to
the exit where there is another Winona walking away.

          I’ve lived    just as many years on
          this earth    as you. You think I
          don’t know    that life is just
          running in    circles? I just think I
          would have    really liked doing taxes

She attempts one last smile, before turning and going.

HERO UNIVERSE - EXT. IRS BUILDING

Desmond is   still holding Winona hostage. They are surrounded
by throngs   of police, medical personnel, and IRS building
employees,   many of whom Jackie has hurt over the course of
this crazy   day. All eyes are on Jackie.
Jackie is only looking at Winona.
Winona can see that something in Jackie has changed. He has
given up.
                       JACKIE
             I’m sorry. I surrender.

Desmond takes his gun and points it at Jackie. Just as he is
about to pull the trigger Winona steps between the two men.

          then I close my eyes and poof I’m
          somewhere else and every one is
          yelling and I don’t remember how I
          got there...
The intensity in Desmond’s face increases.

                     WINONA
          I don’t know what’s going on, but I
          do know that we all have to try to
          be good people, especially when no
          one knows what the fuck is
          happening!
Jackie can’t help but feel touched. Desmond’s face contorts,
until he exhales- almost laughs. He tries to say something
but he doesn’t know what to say. He lowers the gun.

                    DESMOND
               (shell shocked)
          I’ve been having the same exact
          day. I thought I was doing the
          right thing, but...
He starts to cry. Winona holds him and pats him like her own
child. No one can believe that worked.

HERO UNIVERSE - EXT. IRS BUILDING

Though Desmond has collapsed on the ground in tears, the
others are not so moved. The SWAT officers and the other
angry IRS employees move in on Jackie and Winona.
Jackie tries to go to Winona to protect her from the chaos
he’s caused but doesn’t want to hurt more of these people in
the process. He looses sight of Winona as they beat and
kick him.

Jackie Rock is watching Winona in every universe.
Suddenly the camera pushes in: Jackie has an idea-

WRITER UNIVERSE - INT. HOME OFFICE
Jackie.Writer sits up from his couch where he was balled up
and looks at the photo of him and Chris. He has a sudden
realization. Then:

A flurry of keyboard strokes. Letters sprawling across the
screen.

The last page is ripped from the printer.
And out the door he goes.

WRITER UNIVERSE - INT. CAR

Jackie.Writer speeds down the road, oxygen tank in the

Jackie enters holding his manuscript. He scans the late
night bar crowd. He spots Chris.

Before Jackie can even say anything, Chris interrupts.
                    CHRIS
          How’d you know I was going to be
          here.
                    JACKIE
          I know you.
Beat of silence.
Chris sighs and takes his jacket off the seat beside him.

Jackie is still being beaten.

As one of the SWAT members takes another swing, his helmet
falls from his face. Though he has no recognition of Jackie,
Jackie recognizes him:
It’s Chris, his husband and editor, in another life.
Jackie gets up on one knee to get a better look.
                    CHRIS.SWAT
          Stay on the ground!

                    JACKIE
          I know you.

                    CHRIS.SWAT

He goes for another swing.

               (dry)
          Oh, great, you’ve written me into
          the story too. So fun.
Chris is reading very mechanically. He is scribbling notes
and crossing out entire sentences like an automated robot.

                    CHRIS
               (skimming quickly)
          "he realizes, in another universe,
          the two of them aren’t strangers,
          but lovers"...
               (putting down paper)
          Okay I get it, thank you, I’m so
          glad I get to be immortalized as a
          minor minor character that is
          shoehorned in as some emotional key
          for your protagonist in what is
          potentially going to be, and I mean
          no offense here, just speaking
          objectively as your husband, your
          worst book ever.
Jackie doesn’t even seem fazed. He even smiles.
                    JACKIE
          Keep reading.

With a prominent shake of the head, Chris continues reading.
The smug look on his face disappears. He mouths along in
astonishment.
We see the text he is reading is exactly what he just said:
"I get to be immortalized as a minor", "shoehorned in as
some emotional key", "just speaking objectively as your
husband".

Jackie looks around at each and every individual. He sees
flashes of other universes; he has lived with each of them.
One of them a neighbor, another a best friend, a sister. He
sees them all and how they could have been connected-- no,
how they are connected.
Jackie faces off against them as they approach menacingly.

as the SWAT officer is about hit the ground, Jackie
seamlessly turns a car tire into a couch cushion and gently
catches his fall.

             With kindness.
Winona shakes her head in disbelief.

As the officer falls, his helmet falls off revealing he is
actually the Sign Spinner’s boss.

Jackie dives, just as the Swat / Sign Spinner boss fires a
wired taser at him, it splinters into a tree behind him.
Jackie takes the two taser wires in his hands and they turn
into ear buds. He sticks them into the Sign Spinner boss’s
ears, and grabs the taser, it instantly turns into an old
ipod.

It plays a folk song that only the Sign Spinner Boss knows
because his mother used to sing it to him. A peace falls
over his face.

Jackie rolls back onto his feet-

In one fluid motion, Jackie riding on Beefy’s shoulders
dodges a gunshot, knocks a SWAT member’s helmet off, and
slices his kevlar jacket, ripping open the breast pocket of

catches it and hands it to the man: its Mcgregor.

He rips out a grenade from someone’s belt and presses down
the pin like a perfume bottle, spraying a mist in someone’s
face, causing them to sigh with nostalgia.
He blocks three punches from someone else, catches her arm
and then pets himself behind the ear with her hand while
panting like a dog.

                    WINONA
          I don’t want this.
                    JACKIE

                                                        129.

          Okay.
                    JACKIE
          Okay.
She rips up the divorce papers.
Jackie and Winona look at the torn up paper.
                    JACKIE
          What do we do now?

                    WINONA
          Whatever we want.

                    JACKIE
          I want to finish these taxes with
          you.

Jackie grabs Winona’s hand and they are running through the
airport like young lovers.

SPAGHETTI UNIVERSE - INT. BOILING POT
A stray spaghetti strand reaches out of the fray and down
into the depths of the pot to grabs onto his son.
                    SPAGHETTI BABY NOODLE BOY
          What are you doing?

                    JACKIE.SPAGHETTI
          Our boiling time is almost up.

                    SPAGHETTI BABY NOODLE BOY
          But you said-
Jackie.Spaghetti pushes his noodle body through his macaroni
son’s elbow and lifts him off the bottom of the pot.
Noodle Baby Boy looks about as shocked as a noodle baby boy
can be.

FIGHTER UNIVERSE - INT. FIGHTING ARENA

Jackie.Fighter throws all he has into a roundhouse
punch. McGregor ducks it and counters. Jackie stumbles back
impressed.
Blinded by the light, Jackie sees a momentary vision in the
light: his Old Master takes a bow.
                    OLD MASTER
          You haven’t forgotten.
Jackie nods and smiles.
McGregor’s daughter watches with anticipation.

                    JACKIE.SPAGHETTI
          You’re ready. Don’t be afraid.
A giant chef hand plucks them from the spoon.
                    JACKIE.SPAGHETTI
          Here we go.
He throws them-
Noodle-father-threaded-through-noodle-son. It’s magical,
like flying.

TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. APARTMENT DINING ROOM
Jackie.Taxes wipes the dripping sweat from his face as he is
scribbling on a notepad. Winona is beside him furiously
organizing receipts. They pass things back and forth like a
dance.

TAP. He slices an inky underline across his page-
                                                        131.

Joy’s head slowly is pulled towards Jackie’s shoulder. It
makes contact. Her face relaxes. She exhales.


WRITER UNIVERSE - INT. HOME OFFICE
Command S!   The screen reads "Saving document..."


TAXES UNIVERSE - INT. CHAN APARTMENT
Jackie.Taxes pen explodes, ink gently sprays against the
paper.
The chaos slowly stops.   We hear the overlapping sounds
gently subside.
Jackie throws the pen in the trash and finds another one. He
finishes writing one last number and circles the final
tally.

Jackie and Winona look at each other.
                                                      132.

INT. IRS LOBBY - MORNING
Jackie and Winona walk down the hallway just like yesterday.

                     JACKIE
           Can I say something?

                      WINONA
                (hesitant)
           Of course.
                     JACKIE
           Now I’m always going to be scared
           you’ll want to divorce me again.

                     WINONA
           Sorry.
                     JACKIE
           No, it’s kind of nice. I can’t get
           lazy.
                     WINONA
           Well, I don’t want to divorce you
           today, okay?
                     JACKIE
           Okay.
Winona grabs Jackie’s hand.

He looks at her a bit unsure then squeezes it back.
They walk like that, holding hands towards the elevator.
It’s like middle school again. It’s like first love.
                     WINONA
           I have to use the restroom.
                     JACKIE
           I’ll hold your purse?

She hands it to him, grateful, then she turns away.
                                                     133.


                    JACKIE
          Wait.
He grabs her hand again and pulls her in.

AND THEY KISS!
Probably for the first time in years he kisses her and she
kisses him back.

INT. IRS 9TH FLOOR OFFICE - LATER

A wall of triumphant music plays as Jackie and Winona sit in
front of Desmond who sips another protein shake.

With saintlike serenity, they hold hands and patiently wait
as Desmond lists all of their infractions and thumbs through
a pile of red sticky notes. The camera slowly pulls back
from this mundane moment.
Jackie and Winona look at each other. They both inhale.
